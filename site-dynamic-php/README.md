# Dynamic site using PHP

The content found in this directory is governed by the [project license](https://github.com/8fold/site-joshbruce.com/blob/main/.github/LICENSE) and copyright.

The code is educational as well as functional.

Part of the experiments being run for this project is trying different ways to deliver the [joshbruce.com](https://joshbruce.com) site.

The entryway to the rabbit-hole is the `index.php` file found in the `public` directory.
