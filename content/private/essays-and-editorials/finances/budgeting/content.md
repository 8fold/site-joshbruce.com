# Budgeting

I've always been torn on the word "budget." Mainly because I think the connotation of the word has overtaken the denotation (common use) of the word, which is:

> an estimate of income and expenditure for a set period of time.

That's not bad or scary, right?

Unfortunately, many think of budgeting in terms of another word whose connotation has given it a bad rap; "diet," which has two common uses:

> 1. the kinds of food that a person, animal, or community habitually eats
> 2. a special course of food to which one restricts oneself, either to lose weight or for medical reasons

When we talk about the bad rap of the word budget, we’re talking about that second usage. In other words, budget means restricting spending, not estimating income and expenses in a given period. 

I don't do restriction well. Hell, I barely do delayed gratification well.

Budget can be both a verb and a noun. Budget as a verb means to allow a certain amount of money to be allocated toward something in a budget (noun).

Just like you have a diet (the food you habitually eat), you have a budget. The question here is how intentional and transparent is that budget (diet)? How mindful are you of that budget (diet)?

To talk budgeting we need to talk about bookkeeping.

To keep the diet metaphor going bookkeeping is equivalent to calorie tracking. How many did you eat? How many did you burn? Only, for finances, it’s income and expenses alongside credits and debits; the latter can be hella confusing sometimes.

## Chart of accounts

You don’t have to become an expert in the jargon; I’m certainly not. With that said, the concepts and tools just exist, so, capturing them in a way that’s easy for you makes a lot of sense. What we’re building is what’s called a chart of accounts; which for our purposes is a technical term for labels and categories that fall into five buckets:

1. income,
2. expenses,
3. assets,
4. liabilities, and
5. equity.

For money to move from one place to another we need to debit an account (label or category) and credit another; because we create two entries it’s called double-entry bookkeeping.

For income, the list we’re creating is a list of in come sources. If you have a business or side hustle it’s recommended you have a completely different set of books and, at minimum, a different set of accounts; this makes taxes easier. For most of us we will have at least two sources of income:

1. paycheck and
2. interest income.

These are categories and will be applied when creating entries.

Let’s flip to expenses, which is also a list of categories. To keep it simple and absolutely bare bones let’s start with one category: miscellaneous expenses.

With income we are receiving money from a third-party and putting it into an account. With expenses we are sending money to a third-party from an account.

(The financial industry uses the same words to cover a lot of ground, which can get confusing.)

Accounts are labels under assets and liabilities, within different buckets; all about that hierarchy.

For most of us we’ll have a checking and savings account, which looks like this as a list in our chart of accounts:

- assets
	- cash and bank 
		- savings
		- checking

Let’s say you still use cash on occasion, this is still an account and might look like this:

- assets
	- cash and bank 
		- cash in hand
		- savings
		- checking

Same word. Multiple contexts. Fun!

All right, liabilities are very similar. Let’s say you have a credit card and a car loan:

- assets
	- cash and bank 
		- cash in hand
		- savings
		- checking
- liabilities 
	- credit cards
		- main card
	- loans
		- main car

Equity is mainly for business ownership, so, we’ll skip it as it’s not ubiquitous. Therefore, our full chart of accounts looks like this:

- assets
	- cash and bank 
		- cash in hand
		- savings
		- checking
- liabilities 
	- credit cards
		- main card
	- loans
		- main car
- income
	- income
		- paycheck
	- other income
		- interest income (dividends)
- expenses
	- operating expenses 
		- miscellaneous expenses

In the time of free financial tools and aggregators, you don’t need to do this by hand. With that said, starting with pen-and-paper can be helpful in learning and recognizing the non-pen-and-paper bits.

When you get paid, there’s an entry to make and a category to apply. When you pay a bill, there’s an entry to make and a category to apply.

You use your credit card to buy a pair of shoes for 100 [.United States Dollars](USD). The entry goes in the credit card account, categorized as miscellaneous expense. 

You receive a paycheck for 1,000 USD. The entry goes in whichever asset account received it, categorized as paycheck; let’s say checking.

Net worth is assets minus liabilities. Using these two accounts, you’d have a financial net worth of 900 USD.

You pay the credit card. Create an entry to expense 100 USD from the checking account and another to add 100 USD to the negative balance of credit card. Both entries are categorized as a transfer.

Financial net worth is still 900 USD. The difference now is that you don’t have any liabilities.

With this list of accounts with different providers and categories of income and expenses, you can track your budget from a historical perspective (calorie counting) and plan for the future (meal planning). 

Let’s talk about expanding the list of expense categories.

## Categories

This is where I used to get the most overwhelmed. 

In my youth I remember buying accounting software for the time. It was on those “now I feel like an adult” purchases. I opened it up and started adding accounts. Even in 1998 I could sync it with my credit union. 

The transactions filled themselves in but weren’t categorized. I went to the first one and hit the dropdown to apply a category. The list had like 50 entries or something and freaked out a bit.

But I was an adult. This is adults did. I was going to do it. And I did—for about three paychecks.

I found myself not being consistent in how I categorized certain things because there were so many similar categories available by default in the software. I stopped using the software and stopped tracking my budget. If that’s what adults did, I wanted nothing to do with it.

Here’s the thing. I’m better with additive systems. Give me a blank canvas and the guidelines and guardrails for something and I’ll figure it out. Chuck the kitchen sink at me and make me feel like I *must* do something a certain way and I’m probably gonna bail.

So, here’s the guidelines and guardrails I gave myself:

1. As few categories as possible.
2. Focus on capabilities, not low-level, atomic buckets.

Back to the food metaphor.

The miscellaneous expense category is equivalent to calories; I ate something. It’s just a generic was of saying, “I spent money on something.” When I was a kid and I spent money mainly on entertainment and snacks, that’s the only category that really made sense.

With that said, maybe I want to break it down a bit. I could do it by individual meal, or, my preference, of macros. For nutrition that fat, protein, and carbohydrates. Don’t care if you had chicken one day and beef the next; how much protein was involved? For finances you might start with food and shelter; while still having the miscellaneous expense category.

You buy a candy bar, food category. Prepared meals from your gym, food. One of those boxes meal subscription services, food. That latte you bought on Tuesday, food. You pay for a friend at a restaurant, food.

I knew that same word with multiple uses pattern would come in handy.

Electric bill, housing. Internet service provider, housing. And so on.

The categories are there to give you information and perspective, not to track every minute detail.

Of course, you have the option of tracking things a bit further. In nutrition terms this starting to look at micros. Maybe you’re finding yourself spending a lot on food. Break it down for a while; maybe have snacks and dining as sub-categories. Now you can see how much you spent on groceries (just food), candy (food-snacks), and eating out (food-dining).

You notice snacks are consuming more of your budget than you realized and you decide to change that habit. Maybe you really like eating out, so, you decide the money you save on not buying snacks can be shifted to having better dining experiences.

We didn’t “cut calories” we modified how they were spent.

## Summary

There is no money, only food. Every dollar we spend turns into food for someone somewhere at some point.

A budget is like a diet in that if have money (eat), you have one. A budget is not just about controlling and restricting your spending.

Income is money coming in from a third party. An expense is an expense going to a third-party. A transfer is money you move from one of your accounts to another.

A chart of accounts is a list of the places that give you money, categories for how you spend money, and the various accounts that facilitate both.

Don’t overwhelm yourself or let software manufacturers do it for you. This is your world and, when it comes to the details (like categories of expenses), there is no right or wrong.
