{!! dateblock !!}

Talking money has always felt foreign and is one of those subjects socialized to be taboo. Whether you're doing well or poorly, you don't talk about money. Further, someone somewhere will have negative to say about you; either you did it to yourself or you didn't earn it. At least that appears to be the ethos of the United States when it comes to money.

I spent six years working with a credit union and was trained on multiple topics there. In the call center I averaged over 200 calls per day and was introduced to a lot of individual strategies.

As a coach whose worked with multiple clients from the Federal Government to Fortune 500 companies and micro-businesses, I focus on optimization, gamification, and productivity.  Much of this involves automated decision-making, as much is possible and practical. In other words, when faced with an event, I help my clients be in a position to respond quickly because the decision on how to respond has already been made—or feels obvious; this is also something I try to practice in my own life.

When the 2020 pandemic hit, there was no question what I would do. With my [personal character](/about/) as a foundation I called the client and told them I’d be moving from Washington state to Tennessee; I would have done the move regardless—I was stating intent, not asking permission. They understood and didn't remove from the project. I spent the [15 Days to Slow the Spread](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/articles/15-days-slow-spread/) to prepare for the move and the following 3 days actually moving.
