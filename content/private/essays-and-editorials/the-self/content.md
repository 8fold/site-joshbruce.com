# The self

This is what can be described as the I-perspective.

The individual.

There are three questions humans tend to ask themselves and seek to answer for themselves during the lifetime:

1. Where did I come from?
2. Where am I going?
3. Why am I here?

I contend that the first two questions are purely subjective when compared to your lifetime. At some point you did not exist and, at some point, you will exist no more. Sure, we could wax philosophical about how you are constantly dying and being reborn because who you were a nanosecond ago isn't the same you that exists right now; however, I try to be a bit more pragmatic. We could also split semantic hairs and say, well, I came from the house and I'm going to work or similar, but, again, let's try to focus on the spirit and be more pragmatic.

Whether you believe you came from a deity, stardust, or something else, I can't prove you're wrong and you most likely cannot prove, beyond reasonable doubt, that you are correct. Whether you believe you return the deity, dissolve into nothing, or something else, again, I can't prove you're wrong and you most likely cannot prove yourself right.

Yet, throughout history, humans have performed serious pain and suffering because of their beliefs regarding these two questions.

With that out of the way, let's focus on the third question; in pragmatic terms. 

(This third question is why the self-help—or self-improvement—industry exists. An estimate from [MarketResearch.com](https://blog.marketresearch.com/the-10-billion-self-improvement-market-adjusts-to-new-generation) says the self-help industry in the United States will grow to over 13 billion [.United States Dollars](USD) in 2022.)

I haven't meant an individual yet who would deny that, at the highest level, they are here to lead a fulfilling life as defined by them.

Even when we subjugate our desires to the will of another, as long as we are doing it willingly, that's a fulfilling life.

That's a bit abstract and we'll need to get more concrete. Exploring this question and these ideas is what this section of the site is about.

(We'll explore the other two questions, but in a much shorter time-scale.)
