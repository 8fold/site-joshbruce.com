# Productivity and agility

As it stands, I view productivity as balancing efficiency, effectiveness, scope, and speed in a given context. Agility is the ease at which you can adjust that balance when the context changes.

Efficiency is about waste; input minus output. Effectiveness is about quality; not only the quality of the outcome but of the journey in producing the outcome. Scope is about the quantity; this is usually limited to the amount of stuff. Speed is just time over distance.

You can think of these as levers, which is popular in the parlance of our time. 

These qualities are interconnected. If one lever is increased, most likely, other levels will need to be decreased. Further, there is no universal and timeless position. There is only appropriate to the context.

Letâ€™s consider the cheetah and the tortoise.
