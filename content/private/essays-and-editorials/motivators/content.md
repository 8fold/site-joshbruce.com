# The Motivators exercise 

{!!dateblock!!}

This exercise is here to help explore and intentionally define your [individual character](/essays-and-editorials/the-self/) as well as opening the door to defining an intentional [group culture](/essays-and-editorials/the-group/).

The exercise was inspired by Dan Pink’s work in the book *Drive*, Gary Chapman with the *The 5 Love Languages*, and some generation-based demographic research.

There are two versions:

1. short and
2. long.

You are presented with a list of eight to 12 motivators. You sort them from the most to least motivating for you. 

Once the initial sorting is complete you may exercise the option to set distances between them to show how they relate to one another in non-binary arrangement. In other words, the first pass says, “If I only had these two, which is more motivating.” The optional second pass says, “This one is three or for times more motivating than that other one.”

Let’s begin.

Here are the motivators:

Mastery: 
:    Having a master-level understanding of the endeavors you pursue.

Autonomy: 
:    The freedom to choose your own adventure; what you do, when you do, how you do, and so on.

Purpose: 
:    The reason or “why” behind things.

Connection: 
:    Relationships with others (*The 5 Love Languages*).

Process: 
:    The order and formal nature of things.

Sticks: 
:    Negative consequences for your actions.

Numbers: 
:    The facts and figures of things (includes, but not limited to money).

Prestige: 
:    The appreciation and recognition of others or a label that implies more responsibility or respect (office manager not secretary, custodial engineer not janitor, and so on).

Now put them in order. 

How do you interpret what you see?

I had a [.Chief Executive Officer](CEO) tell me money was his top motivator. When he said it he was almost apologetic. I told him not to worry, not of these are morally superior than the others; what he was feeling was group pressure and this was a very selfish exercise. When we finished and started interpreting things I told him, if money and sticks were high, connection was really low, then I might be concerned. However, when it comes to a CEO, I want money to be a motivator because that means you work hard to make more, which means I can stay employed. And, I believe your desire for connection is such that it’s like you want all the money for yourself and your family; employees be damned.

Let’s see what the expanded version looks like. Basically we’re going to replace “connection” with each of the five love languages. 










From this exercise I can start to get a sense of some basic values: purpose and autonomy, for example. This self-knowledge can help me reflect on practices and tools I use; are they in keeping with these values?

And this is how I find identifying your values, principles, practices (or habits), and tools goes. It’s nonlinear. You don’t need to figure out your life’s purpose *before* determining your values *before* stating your principles and so on. Instead, you can start by cataloging your practices and asking yourself why that’s a practice. Or start listing tools you use and ask why you use that tool.

Feel like another example is in order. I use pen-and-paper (tools) for capturing todo items (practice) because I don’t want to forget and I don’t want my mind cluttered. The last bit is in keeping with the principle: Your mind is for having ideas, not storing them. Further, the last bit is in keeping with my value of integrity (keeping my word to self and others). 

There’s more but I want to keep it simple; another value I have. Hopefully it demonstrates the non-linear nature and how the simplest starting point can roll you into other things.

The Motivators exercise is a way to get away from the writer’s block often comes from being asked to figure out what you want to be if you grow up.
