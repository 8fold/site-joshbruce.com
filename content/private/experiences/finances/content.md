# Finances

{!!dateblock!!}

Talking money has always felt foreign and is one of those subjects socialized to be taboo. Whether you're doing well or poorly, you don't talk about money. Further, someone somewhere will have negative to say about you; either you did it to yourself or you didn't earn it. At least that appears to be the ethos of the United States when it comes to money.

I'm not financially ambitious and haven't had a record of earning money; however, I'm pretty good at allocating money when I do have it.

I spent six years working with a credit union and was trained on multiple topics while there. In the call center I talked with an average of 200 people per day and was introduced to a lot of individual strategies.

As a coach whose worked with multiple clients from the Federal Government to Fortune 500 companies and micro-businesses, I focus on optimization, gamification, and productivity.  Much of this involves automated decision-making, as much is possible and practical. In other words, when faced with an event, I help my clients be in a position to respond quickly because the decision on how to respond has already been made; this is also something I try to practice in my own life.

When the 2020 pandemic hit, there was no question what I would do. With my values, principles, practices, and tools as a foundation I called the client and told them I’d be moving from Washington state to Tennessee; I would have done the move regardless—I was stating intent, not asking permission. They understood and didn't remove from the project. I spent the [15 Days to Slow the Spread](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/articles/15-days-slow-spread/) to prepare for the move and the following 3 days actually moving.

The following section described my personal values, principles, practices, and tools with a focus on the financial, however, they may overlap into areas beyond the financial.

In times of stress, I can come back to these and center myself from a time when I was in a more stable place mentally, emotionally, and financially.

## Values

1. Autonomy: When I do the [Motivators exercise](/design-your-life/motivators/) on myself, the ability to "choose my own adventure" ranks second; every time.
2. My values and principles over social norms and mores.
3. Intellectual legacy over
    - financial legacy over
    - genetic legacy.
4. The most constrained over the most funded.
5. United States over International.
6. Passive management over
    - passive investing over
    - active investing over
    - active management.
7. Index funds over
    - individual stocks over
    - bonds.
8. Equities (ownership) over bonds (lending).
9. Small, local businesses over
    - large, multinational businesses over
    - local governments over
    - state governments over
    - federal governments.
10. Cooperative business structures over
    - privately held over
    - publicly traded.
11. Time in the market over timing the market.
12. Being in the market over beating the market.

## Principles

1. Corporate profits favor owners; owning equity shares makes you an owner of the company.
2. The borrower is slave to the lender; owning bonds makes you the lender to the government or corporation.
3. Dividends created in a security don't need to compound in that security.
4. If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.
5. Rising tides lift all boats and don't get caught skinny dipping during when they recede.
6. Money is food, not blood.
7. The macro-allocation principle.

## Practices

1. Maximize revenue, minimize spending, save and invest the gap.
2. Combined expense ratio less than 1%.
3. Maximize the number of people supporting your progress.
4. Think win-win and meeting in the middle.
5. Pay yourself first.
6. Promote dividends earned in securities returning less than 7% per year to securities that historically return higher.
7. Higher rates of return should be lowest priority consideration when making decisions (see previous).
8. [Building Wealth Paycheck to Paycheck](/finances/building-wealth-paycheck-to-paycheck/).
9. Don't take out a loan to buy an investment; investing on margin (no leveraged investments).
10. Don’t bet on others to fail (no shorting stocks, funds, or companies).

## Tools

1. [Personal Capital](https://www.personalcapital.com) for tracking the majority of my portfolio; some vendors aren't accessible to them, but it gets me close enough. In particular I appreciate the "You Index" and "Asset Allocation" tools.
2. [Wave](https://www.waveapps.com) for personal and business accounting.
3. [Stripe](https://stripe.com) and [Square](https://squareup.com/us/en) for payment processing, appointments, and the like.
4. One insured spending account: All non-business outflows come from this account.
5. One or more federally insured, interest bearing savings accounts.
6. One or more regulated retirement accounts.
7. One or more regulated taxable accounts.
8. A well-maintained [investment policy](/finances/investment-policy/).
