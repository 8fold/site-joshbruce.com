# April 15th, 2022 paycheck

{!! data !!}

Making progress toward getting my 401k in balance. For the past few contributions I’ve been ramping up the small-cap fund via buying the dip; now it’s almost to the point it needs to be—same cost basis as the S&P 500 fund. I decided to shift my contribution from 80-20 favoring the small-cap to 20-80 favoring the mid-cap. I plan on continuing to sell the large-cap gains and buying the small- and mid-cap funds. Once it’s balanced I’ll change to an even split and rebalance as necessary.

## Portfolio balance overall 

Overall we’re looking pretty good. However, when it comes to the individual funds, it’s time to start buying the mid-cap in the 401k and the total stock market fund. 

This is due in part to shoveling so much toward the small-cap favoring funds, however, that’s not the only reason. I’m going to add another fund; specifically, a cumulative factors fund.

This is not an optimization move; I’m not doing it because I believe it will result in higher returns. Instead, it’s a psychological move to push the portfolio toward my values and principles.

The cap-weighted total stock market fund lets me hold the average investment portfolio of all investors. If someone buys more stock in a company, it’s market capitalization goes up and, when the index fund is rebalanced, more of my value will be in that company. Right now, that average heavily favors large-cap companies and I do not.

The extended market fund lets me shift the size factor ([.small minus big](SMB)) toward small- and mid-cap companies with the goal being a pretty even split between them. 

The multi-factor fund I’m pretty sure I’ll go with favors momentum (strong, recent performance), fundamentals (cash flow and conservative over aggressive), and value (low price compared to fundamentals). There are multiple identified factors and the one I lean toward is the Fama-French five-factor model, which doesn’t include momentum, however, incorporates the others found here. The goal here is to see what shifts to get closer to an even distribution between value, growth, and core according to the Personal Capital grid.

Again, this isn’t optimization for outperformance; see [investment policy](/finances/investment-policy/)—mainly because of the macro-allocation principle: any reasonably diversified portfolio with perform over 90 percent the same as a similar portfolio with similar holdings.

Of course, if more people decide to follow this path, the more the total stock market fund will reflect these holdings, which should mean I’d be able to sell off the more specific funds.

## Odd place

Feeling a bit better now.

## FI experiments

Details are in the [January 15th, 2022 paycheck](https://joshbruce.com/finances/building-wealth-paycheck-to-paycheck/20220115/#fi-experiments).

The hypothesis is when the Mark 0.0 mix is down, it‘ll be down more than the others. Further, when the Mark 0.0 is up, the others will be up and not too far behind the Mark 0.0. We will track the change since the previous paycheck as well as the change since we started tracking January 2022.
