# The self

Here's where you can see the big picture of me. I will mainly use the exercises found in my books and the [essays and editorials](/essays-and-editorials/) area of the site.

## Character


I'm not very good at talking about myself without prompting. So, I'll most likely be revisiting this one a few times as I figure out "the voice" it'll have.

The alphabet soup:

- [.PSM](Professional Scrum Master) I, II, and III; in some cases multiple times
- [.PSPO](Professional Scrum Product Owner) I
- [.PSD](Professional Scrum Developer) I
- [.SPS](Scaled Professional Scrum)
- ICAgile Certified Professional - Agile Coaching
- ICAgile Certified Professional - Agile Team Facilitation
- [.BFA](Bachelor of Fine Arts) with a focus in studio arts

## Values

1. Autonomy: When I do the [Motivators exercise](/design-your-life/motivators/) on myself, the ability to “choose my own adventure” ranks second; every time.
2. My values and principles over social norms and mores.
3. Intellectual legacy over
    - financial legacy over
    - genetic legacy.

## Principles

1. Never enter anything without an exit strategy.
2. There's no such thing as intrinsic value, only perceived value.
3. Scarcity alone doesn't make something more valuable.

## Practices

4. Think win-win and meeting in the middle.
10. Don’t bet on others to fail.
3. Maximize the number of people supporting your progress.

In times of stress, I can come back to these and center myself from a time when I was in a more stable place mentally, emotionally, and financially.

## Motivators exercise results

Here are my results from the [Motivators Exercise](/essays-and-editorials/motivators/).

Short version:

1. purpose,
2. autonomy,
3. mastery,
4. connection,
5. numbers,
6. process,
7. prestige, and
8. sticks.

Regarding range and distance between, sticks is so far from the others I feel comfortable saying I am practically anti-stick. If I signed up for the negative consequence, I see that differently. Further, the top four are pretty close to one another and may even shift around based on context. Finally, the remaining are also pretty close to one another but aren’t exceptionally close to the top four.

Extended version:

1. purpose,
2. autonomy,
3. **physical touch (I’m big on hugs and high-fives)**,
4. **words of affirmation**,
5. **quality time**,
6. mastery,
7. numbers,
8. **acts of service**,
9. **receiving gifts**,
10. process,
11. prestige, and
12. sticks.

Awareness and intent.

Beyond the valuation portion, one of the things this exercise revealed to me is why I’m not particularly ambitious when it comes to finances. It also helped inform my practice of negotiating raises and charging for my services; if left to my own devices I would remain a starving artist, so to speak, I value numbers generally (and money specifically) so little.
