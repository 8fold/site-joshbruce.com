### Contributing content using the GitHub user interface

Navigating to the content you want to edit is similar to navigating the files and folders on your device.

1. Navigate to the content you want to edit; it's like navigating the folder structure of a device.
    - Let's say you want to edit the following page: https://joshbruce.com/software-development.
    - You would:
        1. Click the `public` folder link.
        2. Click the `software-development` folder link.
        3. Click the `content.md` link.
        4. Click the `edit` (pencil) button.
        5. Make the edits inside the form.
        6. Scroll to the bottom of the form and enter a title briefly describing the change. (You can optionally add a longer description.)
        7. Click the `commit changes` button.
        8. Review the title (and long description) and click `create pull request`.
        9. That will put the change in the queue for review, which takes us out out of the rote mechanics.

### Contributing by cloning the repository

If you know, chances are you know. If you don't, GitHub has some really good guides to get started; the [contributing to open source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/) guide has a helpful section on [opening a pull request](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#opening-a-pull-request).
