# Finances

{!! dateblock !!}

Talking about money has always felt foreign to me. In the [.United States](US) it's one of those taboo subjects. Don't talk about how much you make. Don't talk about how much you spend. Just. Don't. Talk. About it.

It's also an area where, whether you're doing poorly or well, someone somewhere will have negative things to say about you; either you did it to yourself or you didn't earn it, respectively. At least that appears to be the ethos of the US when it comes to money.

I spent six years working with a credit union and was trained on multiple financial topics there. In the call center I averaged over 200 calls per day and was introduced to a lot of individual strategies.

As a coach whose worked with multiple clients from the Federal Government to Fortune 500 companies and micro-businesses, I focus on optimization, gamification, and productivity.  Much of this involves automated decision-making, as much is possible and practical. In other words, when faced with an event, I help my clients be in a position to respond quickly because the decision on how to respond has already been made—or feels obvious because of their embodied character; this is also something I practice in my own life.

When the 2020 pandemic hit, there was no question what I would do. With my [personal character](/about/) as a foundation I called the client and told them I’d be moving from Washington state to Tennessee; I would have done the move regardless—I was stating intent, not asking permission. They understood and didn't remove me from the project. I spent the [15 Days to Slow the Spread](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/articles/15-days-slow-spread/) to prepare for the move and the following 3 days making the drive.

## Saving isn't investing

The biggest difference between saving and investing, as I've taken to using the terms, is saving involves currency while investing involves conversion to some other asset; specifically an asset that generates income and is believed to increase or hold its original value (cost basis) over time. Arguably, investing is a type of saving.

Cash is a liquid asset traded directly for goods and services.

In the case of the [.United States Dollar](USD), the Federal Reserve is the only sanctioned entity that can create or destroy it. The USD is similar to many other currencies found around the world.

Because cash doesn't typically expire (like foodstuffs), it affords (pun intended) the opportunity for hoarding; being taken out of circulation by private individuals. To combat hoarding, the creators and destroyers of the currency tend to print more of it. Currencies can be seen as a share in the entity that who (or for whom) the currency is created; in the case of the USD, it's a share in the United States. Therefore, printing more of the currency is similar to when companies [dilute their stock](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/06/dilutivestock.asp) by issuing more shares; this is different than splitting the stock. While a company may dilute its stock whenever it wants to, it is often done when a single shareholder controls (holds) too high of a percentage of the company (shares). So, people hoard cash, which effectively takes it out of circulation, the supply of cash in circulation decreases, if demand for the currency increases or even remains the same, those in charge of the currency print more of it. The reverse can also happen. In corporate terms, this is a stock buyback; the company itself will buy its own stock and not reissue them. The money printers (US Federal Reserve, for example) have a few ways to do it.

This is a very simplified explanation. Having said that, the general rule of thumb is that the more cash gets put into circulation and the easier it becomes to attain the higher prices will to go; resulting in inflation. 

Cash is considered a liquid asset as it can be traded directly for products and services. This is in contrast to more illiquid assets, like a house. Typically we don't trade houses for products and services, they must be sold (liquidated to cash). The time it takes to convert can be weeks, months, or, in some cases, years.

The only way to lose money from an investment is to sell the asset for less than you purchased it for. (Beware the sunk cost fallacy.)

This bears repeating:

> The only way to lose money from an investment is to sell the asset for less than you purchased it for.

Looked at a different way, the moment I purchase an asset (convert cash to something else), I've "lost" the money because it's no longer cash. From that point forward, the question is: What is the fair market value of the thing I purchased? 

If the fair market value is more than I paid, I haven't made money, I have an unrealized gain. If I sell the thing at the higher value, I have a realized gain in capital; made money. 

If the fair market value is less than I paid for it, I haven't lost money, I have an unrealized loss. If I sell it for the lower amount, I have a realized loss in capital. 

At all other points, the asset is just increasing or decreasing in fair market value; I'm neither making or losing money.

Finally, just because I use cash to purchase something doesn't mean I've made an investment.

### The three principles of investing

These three principles are attributed to [Jack Bogle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Bogle) (founder of [Vanguard](https://investor.vanguard.com/corporate-portal/)) and [Ray Dalio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Dalio) (from the hedge fund [Bridgewater Associates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgewater_Associates)). (I credit Frank Vasquez from [Risk Parity Radio](https://www.riskparityradio.com) with introducing me to these.)

The **macro-allocation principle** says that portfolios made of similar asset classes in similar proportions will act over 90 percent the same. All 100 percent stock portfolios will act over 90 percent the same, for example. This means changes to the proportions within the asset classes are somewhat moot when it comes to returns, gains, losses, and so on.

The **Holy Grail of Investing** says that asset classes have an environment in which they perform best. Consider a quad chart. The first column is an inflationary environment where the purchasing power of a currency reduces. The second column is a deflationary environment; purchasing power of the same currency increases. The top row is a growth environment. The bottom row is a compressing environment. What we want to do, according to this principle, is choose different asset classes that perform well in each environment and then set proportions to our comfort. In general, this means equities, bonds, gold, and something like commodities (or literally commodities). The key is that each asset class should have low- or negative-correlation with the others.

The **simplicity principle** says we want to abide by the previous two principles while minimizing the number of securities and fees; simple.

## Investing, speculating, and gambling aren't the same

I think it'll be easier and more direct to take these in reverse order compared to the heading.

I go to a casino (or a [Chuck E. Cheese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_E._Cheese)). I trade cash for tokens or chips. I use those tokens or chips to participate in various games. As I play I win and lose tokens. If I win more tokens than I started with, the value of the asset I purchased (my pool of tokens) has gone up. If I lose tokens, the value of the asset I purchased has gone down. At the end of my time playing, I can exchange the tokens for cash. The majority of people who go to the casino leave with less cash; that's what makes it gambling.

In the case of carnival-like systems, such as Chuck E. Cheese, it's pretty clever. I trade a dollar for [4 metal tokens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_E._Cheese#Video_arcade) that can only be spent at Chuck E. Cheese; metal feels more expensive than paper and I traded 1 paper thing for 4 metal things. I spend the tokens to play [skee-ball](https://www.skeeball.com). As I play, I earn paper tickets (feel less expensive than the tokens), however, I often receive a higher quantity of paper tickets compared to the number of tokens used to play the game (1 token and I get 8 tickets); I feel like I'm getting more. Then I can trade those paper tickets in for a toy of some kind, which is usually worth less than the amount of cash it took for me to play the game. Further, I'm often left with 1 or 2 tickets, tokens, or both that can't be converted directly to cash and might cause me to purchase more tokens to 0 out. The activity and contrast of the trades makes it feel like I'm winning though and the concept of sunk cost can entice me to continue playing and losing monetary value in the exchange; it's gambling.

In the case of carnivals we'd likely call it spending money and not gambling because we're usually not hoping for nor expecting a higher value return compared to the cash put in, which is different than how many feel about going to the casino or playing the lottery.

Speculating is similar to gambling only the probability of a positive return on the cash spent is higher though uncertain.

Cryptocurrencies, for example, as of this writing, could be considered speculative. The speculative nature comes in part because they are:

1. highly volatile when it comes to fair market value,
2. a newer technological implementation of the [same old concepts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/community_currencies.asp) (like community currencies, casino chips, Chuck E. Cheese, and, yes, government-backed currencies), and
3. the regulations for them and the service industry that's emerged to support cryptocurrencies are also in flux.

Further, the primary way to increase profit compared to the cash spent is based solely on someone else in the future being willing to pay more than you paid.

Investing is similar to speculating only the probability of a positive return on the cash spent is higher than either speculating or gambling and, at least in terms of stocks and bonds, dividends are paid regularly. It's not to say it's guaranteed that you'll receive dividends or the value will increase just that we have a long history demonstrating a positive return; in the case of the New York Stock Exchange in the US, that history starts in 1792, however, tracking data took a minute and many datasets go back to around 1900.

### The 10 questions

These 10 questions represent a proposed method of determining if something is an investment, speculation, or gamble and are proposed by J. David Stein in his book *Money for the Rest of Us*. 

1. What is it?
2. Is it investing, speculating, or gambling?
3. What’s the upside?
4. What’s the downside?
5. Who’s on the other side of the trade?
6. What’s the investment vehicle?
7. What does it take to be successful?
8. Who’s getting a cut?
9. How does it impact your portfolio?
10. Should you invest?

What I appreciate about this approach is it helps cover the age-old advice (another principle) of don’t buy into things you don’t understand.

Let’s take VTSAX in a 100 percent equities portfolio.

1. An index fund purchasing shares of every company registered with The New York Stock Exchange in proportion to the market capitalization of the company.
2. Investing: it pays dividends and each share may increase or decrease in value over time.
3. It invests in all stocks available in the New York Stock Exchange, therefore, the likelihood of going to 0 is minimal and, if it does, there are probably bigger concerns than the value of the portfolio. It pays dividends on a regular basis. Vanguard is owned by its investors. VTSAX is a long-running, well-known, and relatively liquid security. And so on.
4. It could lose value compared to what I’ve put in and could take a long time to recover. And so on.
5. It’s passively managed by Vanguard.
6. Index mutual fund; I’m investing in Vanguard as much as the companies underlying the fund.
7. Does better in growth environments and favors large-cap companies.
8. Vanguard takes a percentage for passive management of the fund. The expense ratio as of this writing is 0.04 percent per year. This percent is converted to a daily percent and the gains and losses are adjusted by that percent daily.
9. Because it’s 100 percent of the portfolio, it is the portfolio.
10. I’m in accumulation mode with more than 10 years before needing to withdraw, have a high risk tolerance, and capacity, so, pretty easy to say yes here.

It’s important to note that the majority of responses are not based on emotion. With that said, adding in more emotional considerations aren't inherently a problem.

For example, I tend to favor even distribution across small-, mid-, and large-cap companies when it comes to investing in the United States stock market. VTSAX favors large-cap companies. So, I added other funds that afford me the opportunity to distribute my contributions more evenly; despite the downside of slightly increasing expense ratios and complexity as well as knowing the portfolios will perform pretty similarly. In other words, the change isn’t because I think my mix will outperform anything; it makes me feel better.

## Net worth isn't the same as cash on hand

As of this writing, I'm part of the six-figure club, which is to say I have a net worth greater than 100,000 USD and less than 1 million USD; this doesn't mean I have that in cash. When we say someone is a millionaire or billionaire it's because, if we liquidated their assets and paid off their liabilities, they would, in theory, have that much cash remaining. However, if we liquidated their assets, eventually the fair market value of the assets would likely drop in value (scarcity model and mindset).

The US Government can't tax the same dollar twice. So, as of right now and my understanding, if I put 100 USD of after-tax money into a savings account and that 100 USD earns 10 USD in dividends, I could get taxed on the 10 USD but not the 100 USD which was already taxed. Only realized gains or losses have potential tax implications; not money that has already been taxed. (As of 2022, [legislation is being considered](https://investmentu.com/unrealized-gains-tax/) that would tax unrealized gains for people with an income—or net worth—over a certain threshold. Another way to combat hoarding and put money back into circulation; however, this is would done by the Government, not the Federal Reserve.)

I'm still looking for non-partisan primary sources for the following and, given the rules of the tax game, this seems reasonable. The majority (over 80 percent) of taxes collected by the US Government are collected from individuals, not corporations (not speculating why). 97 percent of taxes paid comes from 50 percent of tax payers. 40 percent of taxes are paid by the top 1 percent of earners (those earning over 500,000 USD per year in taxable income). (Again, haven't found primary sources that didn't include some form of slant or misrepresentation of those numbers.)

There are two ways to pay 0 taxes:

- have a taxable income of 0 USD or
- have acquired less than a certain amount in long-term capital gains.

(Taxes in the United States are weird; I think I understand how we got here from an infinite game perspective, but still.)

Gross income and taxable income aren't the same thing.

Let's say you work somewhere and earn less than or equal to 12,500 USD in 2021 and you are filing your taxes as a single person. Your taxable income is 0 USD because of the standard deduction everyone gets to take.

Let's say you earned 32,000 USD and you contributed the full amount of 19,500 USD to your 401k (in 2021), you're taxable income should be 0; the 12,500 USD standard deduction and the 19,500 USD to a retirement plan that lowers your adjusted gross income.

Let's say you earned 35,600 USD. You maxed out the 401k and maxed out a [.Health Savings Account](HSA) contribution for the year; taxable income of roughly 0. (Check out [this calculator](https://www.taxact.com/tools/tax-bracket-calculator).)

Now, let's say you threw 100 USD of after-tax money into the aforementioned stock then sold it 10 months later for 110 USD. The 100 USD wouldn't be taxed, but the 10 USD would count as regular, taxable income.

Federal long-term capital gains rules have [their own progressive tax](https://www.fool.com/research/capital-gains-tax-rates/).

Let's say you invested 60,000 after-tax USD, a few years later it's now worth 100,000 USD. If you sell for the whole 100,000 USD the 60,000 USD doesn't have any tax implications because it's been taxed. The 40,000 USD in gains is not taxed because the long-term capital gains progressive tax is 0 percent on up to 40,000 USD (in 2021). You now have 100,000 USD and have paid 0 taxes on it. Granted, you had to have earned 60,000 and invested it, then waited long enough for it to increase in value by 40,000 USD; you are paid for patience and investing in the redistribution of assets.

Basically, looking at it from an ethical social engineering perspective, the US Government is trying to incentivize long-term saving and investing through the tax code with tax deductions, tax-free growth, and in the case of HSAs and the Roth Individual Retirement Account, tax-free withdrawals. Further, if you're living strictly on capital gains from various investments (retired), you can live a modest lifestyle without paying any taxes; the moment you go over that 40,000 USD point though, you pay 15% tax on the amount you went over. So, also incentivizing modest living.

One more thing: Net worth has nothing to do with actual worth as a human. To be more accurate it's financial net worth. If all assets were liquidated and all liabilities were paid off, the difference is financial net worth, which is arguably a small part of you actual worth as a human.

## Accumulation, drawdown, and rebalancing

Finances can be divided into two primary modes:

1. accumulation and
2. drawdown.

When in accumulation mode, you receive most revenue from an outside source; employment, sales, and similar. (Someone else’s assets become yours.) When in drawdown, you're giving your assets to someone else or otherwise liquidating them. It's less a light-switch and more a spectrum.

In accumulation mode, you want to purchase assets that are less valuable per unit now. In drawdown, you want to sell assets that have increased in value compared to the overall portfolio and original purchase cost basis (how much you spent to acquire the asset).

Being able to shift strategies between purchasing low and selling high is one reason for having more than one type of security; this is *not* the same as diversification.

For example, as of this writing, I'm operating a variation on what is sometimes called the VTSAX and chill approach. In short, this approach asks us to increase income while reducing expenses and investing the difference in a total stock market index fund (specifically [VTSAX](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/VTSAX)) and hold on for the ride. As the cost per share of the index fund goes up, we are constantly buying in at the higher price; thereby, increasing our average cost basis. When the cost per share goes down, we are buying low. In no case are we selling or divesting to something else. (For details on what I'm doing, check out the [personal finances](/finances/) area.

Index funds are a form of mutual fund. A mutual fund is a way for individuals to pool their resources and invest in various securities that they may not be able to alone; if the stock price for a company, for example, is beyond your ability to pay, you may be able to invest in that company using a mutual fund. Index funds, VTSAX, use a calculation to determine the asset allocation; this is referred to as passive management, because the person in charge of the mutual fund isn't making decisions on individual investments, instead, they are following the allocations set by the index.


Mutually funds are internally rebalanced on a regular basis. You should be able to see the rebalancing strategy by examining the prospectus for the index fund. When the index fund is rebalanced, it can impact your tax liability; this is why some people want to avoid investing directly in index funds and may, instead, invest in [.exchange traded funds](ETFs) so they can have more control in the tax implications.

Another difference with investing is in proxy investing and direct investing. Investing in mutual and index funds is proxy investing; you are purchasing an asset that is used to purchase another asset. Direct investing would be purchasing the asset directly; you purchase a share of a company, for example, you now have the rights, responsibilities, and affordances of an owner in that company, which usually includes voting on certain decisions of the company. When you buy shares of a mutual fund, the fund manager, as the owner of the underlying investments, attains these rights, responsibilities, and affordances, not you; they are your proxy.

This can sometimes create the concentrations in ownership referenced above. A broker, for example, may own a heavy concentration of a particular company and, by extension, have greater voting power than any individual investor.

## Cost basis, capital gains (or losses), and methods

You buy 100 shares of an index fund for 1 USD each (lot 1); 100 USD on day one. On day two you buy another 100 shares of the same index fund for 2 USD each (lot 2); 200 USD. Your total cost basis is 300 USD and you have 200 shares valued at 2 USD each. On day three the fair market value of a single share is 3 USD, which means the value of your investment is 600 USD; 200 shares at 3 USD each.

300 USD is your cost basis and 300 USD is an unrealized capital gain, which is spread across two lots. (If the fair market value was 200 USD, the 100 USD difference between the value and your cost basis is an unrealized capital loss.)

Let's say you want to sell 60 USD worth of shares at 3 USD each; 20 of your 200 shares (10 percent). The transaction can be performed using various [methods](https://investor.vanguard.com/taxes/cost-basis/methods) (the link is for Vanguard; other brokerage firms should allow similar methods):

1. average cost;
2. first in, first out;
3. highest in, first out; and
4. lot [.identifier](ID) (or specific ID).

I don't understand average cost enough yet, so, we'll skip it. Mainly, I'm not sure the implications when it comes to capital gains and losses except what is noted in the link; in limited circumstances, capital gains or losses may be converted to short-term instead of long-term.

First in, first out sells the oldest shares purchased first. This increases the possibility that the sale will fall under long-term capital gain and loss rules. It also means, there's a chance, there will be more capital gains compared to the cost basis of those shares compared to younger shares.

Highest in, first out sells the shares based on the price paid, not the date of purchase and will sell the more expensive ones first. As a result, this method should take better advantage of both capital gains and losses, however, (as stated in the link) in limited cases short-term capital gains or losses may be realized before long-term.

Lot ID means you get to look at each lot and shares you've purchased and choose which to sell. This offers the most flexibility, requires the most work, and carries the most risk should undesired results occur. With the lot ID method, you may decide to sell a bunch of shares in something that had a lot of capital gains along with something else that had some capital losses to possibly reduce the overall tax footprint.

In general, I'd say we don't want dividends automatically reinvesting except if there's only one security at play (VTSAX and chill), or, the account in question is a tax-advantaged account; where rebalancing and dividends won't be a taxable event. Instead, have the dividends kick out into the settlement account, then purchase back into whatever makes the most sense and only after reducing the amount to cover taxes for those dividends.

## Bulls, bears, and corrections

Most days, The New York Stock Exchange (the largest, most well known exchange in the US) is, well, just the stock market. With that said, there are certain events that have been given names. It's important to note that, from what I understand, there's a difference between events happening in or to "the market" and events happening to folks in general, however, the two may experience good and bad at the same time.

A bull market means fair market values of things are tending to increase roughly 20 percent in a two month stretch; a bear market is the opposite. A correction is a decrease of 10 percent in a short period of time. A crash is a decrease of 40 percent or more.

So, from highest to lowest the market goes like this:

1. bull (20 percent up),
2. stable,
3. correction (10 percent down),
4. bear (20 percent down),
5. crash (40 percent or more).

Since 1900, corrections have occurred [about once a year](https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2013/11/difference-crash-correction/) and last about 4 months. Bear markets have happened roughly every 3.5 years and last roughly one year. Crashes have happened roughly once every 12 years, not sure how long they last because there seems to be some debate on how many have occurred (at least in the US). When I talk about how long they each last, what I'm referring to is the time it took before the market was considered to have returned to its previous highest point; this is different than when values start to rise again in general.

Corrections tend to be short-term events, as the name implies, once the market has corrected we should be in a roughly stable state; I think of corrections as the market rebalancing its portfolio (systems thinkers of the world unite, or something). Historically the stable state for The New York Stock Exchange is roughly an 8 percent increase year over year.

I'll try to be explicit in saying The New York Stock Exchange because "the stock market" is a misnomer, because not all stocks available for purchase are in The New York Stock Exchange. There are roughly 4,000 companies listed on The New York Stock Exchange, as of this writing, and there are literally millions of businesses registered in the United States, all of which have at least one stock or share. This is why I try to avoid using the term "the market," because "the market" is vast and The New York Stock Exchange represents a fraction; diverse as it might be, you have to be a certain type of business to even be listed there (no judgment on the businesses that are listed).

A recession and depression are not necessarily related to the stock market in general. Instead these are terms for how businesses and employment are functioning. Granted if business begins to shrink and employment does the same, chances are people won't be pumping money into the stock market.

With that said, these are factors when considering risk tolerance and risk capacity.

## Risk tolerance and risk capacity

It may be worth considering risk tolerance and risk capacity as well. Risk tolerance is your ability to "hold the line" during good and bad times. Risk capacity is your ability to recover from (or at least weather) the bad times.

If your financial net worth dropped by 20 percent and stayed that way for a year or more, could you be okay?

This is one of the reasons [investment policies](/essays-and-editorials/finances/investment-policies/) and [budgets](/essays-and-editorials/finances/budgeting/) can be so powerful; they help you determine your risk tolerance and capacity.

## Being rich and looking rich aren't the same

A couple more interesting sets of figures I plan to consider further regarding sources and accuracy.

The first set has to do with those with a net worth of a million USD or more. Roughly 80 percent of millionaires are considered first generation, which is to say they didn’t inherit a million USD. Further, 60 percent of them didn’t inherit more than 100,000 USD. Finally, a majority (over 50 percent) didn’t reach a net worth of a million USD until after age 50 and most of their net worth was inside an employer-sponsored retirement plan (like a 401k) and their home.

The second set of figures has to do with generational wealth; what I’ve heard called the wealth wash cycle. 50 percent of inherited wealth will be lost by the second generation and 90 percent will be lost by the third generation. I’m not sure if this includes inheritance to multiple parties. What if 10 million USD is divided amongst 10 siblings; one million each? Does this dataset mean 5 million USD will be lost by the second generation, that 5 of the siblings will lose all of their inheritance, or does it include both. (It’s worth noting that this isn’t to say generational wealth doesn’t exist or that something like trickle down economics works at a scale large enough to matter.)

There’s a sort of template phrasing that goes like this:

> X rich, Y poor.

**Life rich, cash (or retirement) poor:** Is the most generic and sometimes used as shorthand to describe someone whose lifestyle gives the appearance of having a lot of money, however, when viewed from a per paycheck basis (or accounting for liabilities), they don’t have a lot of cash flow or discretionary funds. This could be traveling, owning expensive assets like cars, something else, or a combination. “They must be rich,” might be a response made by onlookers.

**House (or car) rich, cash (or retirement) poor:** Similar to the previous only this time it’s a particular type of asset. Having a one million USD home or car that accounts for the majority (or all) of their financial net worth.

There are plenty more of these turns of phrase, the point being that in one aspect the person looks rich, while in another aspect the person appears poor.

Another item of note is how somewhat common being a millionaire is in the United States. [Yahoo! Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/millionaires-america-2020-50-states-201203665.html) references research from Phoenix Marketing International stating there are over 8 million households who can claim millionaire status. With that said, most of them are unknown to us. We usually only hear about those who are more lavish or loud about it. While this is only a little over 2 percent of the US population, the population of the US includes all individuals, including children, not households or groups.

## Glossary

Asset allocation
:    The proportion of each asset class within a portfolio.

Basis point
:    One-hundredth of one percent. *Increasing or decreasing by one basis point is 0.01 percent change in either direction.*

Bonds
:    A loan issued by a company or government whereby you purchase the bond with a promise of repayment with interest. *Bonds are different than shares because shares imply some form of ownership, while bonds do not.*

Capital gain
:    An increase in value of an asset compared to the cost basis.

Capital loss
:    A decrease in value of an asset compared to the cost basis.

Correction
:    A decrease

Cost basis
:    The amount of money it took to acquire an asset.

Diversification
:    Holding multiple assets wherein some assets may increase in value while others decrease in value at different degrees or direction. *One asset may increase while the other decreases or vice versa, or, one asset will rise or fall in fair market value faster or slower than another.*

Dollar cost averaging
:    Spending the same amount on a regular basis on investments regardles of the current fair market value of the security.

Expense ratio
:    The ongoing cost for managing a mutual fund. *The percent is a per year number, however, the percent is usually divided by roughly 365 to generate a Daily percent, which is charged daily.*

Fair market value
:    The amount you can reasonably expect to receive when converting an asset into cash through the sale of that asset; usually based on recent sales of similar assets.

Frontload
:    Associated to accounts with contribution limits (ex. 6,000 USD per year) and refers to cotributing as much as possible as early as possible.

Gambling
:    You trade currency to participate in an activity or for an asset with a high probability of losing money. *In some cases this may feel like purchasing a product, like a car, which we don't tend to view as gambling in the way we would purchasing a lottery ticket.* (Compare to saving, investing, and speculating.)

Hedge fund
:    A privately available mutual fund.

Index
:    A method of tracking the performance of a group of assets in a standardized way.

Index fund
:    A mutual fund intended to follow a benchmark index of assets. *The Dow Jones Industrial Average is an index and there are mutual funds that try and match its performance; those mutual funds are index funds.*

Investing
:    Purchasing a security that produces some form of income and historically increases in fair market value. *A home you live in would not necessarily qualify, however, a house where you collect rent would.* (Compare to saving, speculating, and gambling.)

Liquidity
:    How easily a given security can be traded for products and services in a given context.

Lot
