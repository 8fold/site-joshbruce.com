# Financial advisors

{!! dateblock!!}

I was taking a consultation from a fiduciary advisor the other day and they asked a question I hadn’t really considered before:

> What would it take for you to take on an advisor?

My immediate response was:

> They have to be willing to teach and counsel me to the point that they could become obsolete.

In other words, I don’t want to work with anyone because they hold back trade secrets and knowledge. If the only value someone brings to a relationship requires someone else to be in the dark who doesn’t want to be, that’s a problem.

I have major baggage and biases when it comes to money and I think this question is helping me unpack that a bit, which is the point of the [finances](/experiences/finances/) area of this site.

My mother’s side of the family were pretty much all farmers; peanuts, cotton, corn, and so on. There’s a certain level of distrust for bankers and the Government there. One of my favorite quotes came from my uncle: No one’s gonna care about your money as much as you do.

My dad’s side of the family were much all military for at least minimal service. Again, a certain level of mistrust there.

Both sides are filled with fiercely independent folks; most of whom have run, started to run, or have had multiple side hustles. The do-it-yourself crowd.

Here’s the rub.

I’m trying to break that cycle with myself.
