# Financial advisors

{!! dateblock!!}

I was offered a free consultation with the folks at [Personal Capital](https://www.personalcapital.com) and I took it. During the call they asked a question I hadn’t considered:

> What would it take for you to take on an advisor?

My immediate response was:

> They have to be willing to teach and counsel me to the point that they could become obsolete.

In other words, if part of the relationship depends on me being dependent on the other person without growing and learning, that’s not going to work for me. If life has taught me anything, it’s impermanence and if my advisor disappears without teaching me how to fish, well, that’s not okay.

There’s a fear there though. I recognize, acknowledge, and have lived through myself; I put myself out of business (or a job) on a recurring basis. And I still believe part of my job is to help my clients outgrow me, so to speak; like a [roller derby whip or push](https://youtu.be/l-J4h1kb8Ho).






I have major baggage and biases when it comes to money and I think this question is helping me unpack that a bit, which is the point of the [finances](/experiences/finances/) area of this site.

My mother’s side of the family were pretty much all farmers; peanuts, cotton, corn, and so on. There’s a certain level of distrust for bankers and the Government there. One of my favorite quotes came from my uncle: No one’s gonna care about your money as much as you do.

My dad’s side of the family were much all military for at least minimal service. Again, a certain level of mistrust there.

Both sides are filled with fiercely independent folks; most of whom have run, started to run, or have had multiple side hustles. The do-it-yourself crowd.

Here’s the rub.

I’m trying to break that cycle with myself.
