# June 15th, 2022 paycheck

{!! dateblock !!}

{!! data !!}

Learned that fractional shares will be coming to Vanguard soon. Right now it’s being tested out with a random selection of investors. In the meantime, I wanted to figure out a way to get the benefits of [.exchange traded funds](ETFs); mainly the control over realized gains and losses.

I converted most of my
mutual fund stake to their exchange traded fund equivalent. This way, when I get paid, I can go ahead and send over `x` amount, buy as many ETF shares as possible with it, and send the remaining balance to the mutual fund.

I’m starting to get used to how money flows in the new place. As a result I’ve dropped my self-imposed minimum balance from 1,000 [.United States Dollars](USD) to 500 USD.

## Surgery

I seem to be all healed up. The human body is an amazing thing.

## What to invest in

When I put money into investments it’s about one percent of my overall net worth, so, I can see the impact on the overall goal; roughly equal between size and value-growth.

With the [previous check](/experiences/finances/paycheck-to-paycheck/20220601/) I purchased the total stock market, which shifted growth by about one percent. This time I put it against the extended market fund, which pushed value one percent.

The reason I did the total market was because the extended market was down beyond 30 percent. The reason I did the extended market this time was because it was down just in 30 percent. So, I’m basically purchasing the cheapest fund compared to its 52 week high that is less than a 30 percent drop and won’t throw the portfolio out of balance.

Having said that, I’d like to start getting into the multi-factor fund. So, next paycheck I’ll probably go the full amount in the multi-factor fund and then continue purchasing the dip using the rules in my [personal budget](/experiences/finances/personal-budget/#spending-savings). 

## Future things

I’m considering expanding the breakdown for the components. It would use the `meter` element from [.hypertext markup language](HTML) to make it feel a bit more graphic, while maintaining the accessibility, which is important.

As I was thinking about the meter bit, I got to thinking I could include the value, growth, and core breakdown for the equities portion.

I’m not sure I want to add that level of complexity and bookkeeping though. The justification would need to go beyond these entries. I’m also not sure how much value it’d bring to readers or myself, to be fair.

To be honest I was thinking of getting rid of the breakdown entirely, but I do find it somewhat helpful on my end and it does guide my investment decisions. Just not sure the same would happen for the value, growth, and core components.

Maybe I’ll see how switching to using meters looks and revisit the idea.

## FI experiments 

Details are in the [January 15th, 2022 paycheck](https://joshbruce.com/finances/building-wealth-paycheck-to-paycheck/20220115/#fi-experiments).

The hypothesis is when the Mark 0.0 mix is down, it‘ll be down more than the others. Further, when the Mark 0.0 is up, the others will be up and not too far behind the Mark 0.0. We will track the change since the previous paycheck as well as the change since we started tracking January 2022.
