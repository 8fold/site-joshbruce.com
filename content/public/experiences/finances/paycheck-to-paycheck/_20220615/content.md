# June 15th, 2022 paycheck

{!! dateblock !!}

{!! data !!}

Learned that fractional shares will be coming to Vanguard soon. Right now it’s being tested out with a random selection of investors. In the meantime, I wanted to figure out a way to get the benefits of [.exchange traded funds](ETFs); mainly the control over realized gains and losses.

I converted most of my
mutual fund stake to their exchange traded fund equivalent. This way, when I get paid, I can go ahead and send over `x` amount, buy as many ETF shares as possible with it, and send the remaining balance to the mutual fund.

I’m starting to get used to how money flows in the new place. As a result I’ve dropped my self-imposed minimum balance from 1,000 [.United States Dollars](USD) to 500 USD.

## Surgery

I seem to be all healed up. The human body is an amazing thing.

## What to invest in

When I put money into investments it’s about one percent of my overall net worth, so, I can see the impact on the overall goal; roughly equal between size and value-growth.

With the [previous check](/experiences/finances/paycheck-to-paycheck/20220601/) I purchased the total stock market, which shifted growth by about one percent. This time I put it against the extended market fund, which pushed value one percent.

The reason I did the total market was because the extended market was down beyond 30 percent. The reason I did the extended market this time was because it was down just in 30 percent. So, I’m basically purchasing the cheapest fund compared to its 52 week high that is less than a 30 percent drop and won’t throw the portfolio out of balance.

Having said that, I’d like to start getting into the multi-factor fund. So, next paycheck I’ll probably go the full amount in the multi-factor fund and then continue purchasing the dip using the rules in my [personal budget](/experiences/finances/personal-budget/#spending-savings). 

With all that said, if things keep going as they are, the multi-factor fund will be the only one I can purchase because the other two will be down over 30 percent from their 52 week high.

It’s probably worth noting that using the 52 week high is somewhat arbitrary and is only used to determine what’s down the most. The balance of the portfolio is the primary factor in determining what to purchase.

## The plateau

I mentioned recently that the impact of "all the volatility" of "the market" for me was mainly a plateau. Of course, this could all change tomorrow—for better or worse—but, for now, it's a plateau. I want to show a bit more than just tell on this one because I think it's an interesting illustration of the power of perspective.

The following images are snapshots of my net worth according to [Personal Capital](https://www.personalcapital.com). 

The first image is basically the past 90 days. There are four horizontal bands, so to speak. My net worth starts at the top of the second band on day one and ends at the top of the third one on day 90. At its lowest we hit the top of the first band; the highest is just above the top of the fourth band. And, for most of it, we’re riding along the top of the third band. Hence, the plateau.

Looking at this I might be freaking out because humans tend to reset the scale of charts. In this case, I may look at the chart and think I’ve almost hit zero once and have only managed to go up one band. But, here’s the thing, each band represents roughly four percent of my overall net worth.

So, the first image is hiding, for lack of a better term, 84 percent of my net worth, if the bottom of the chart was zero.

The second image is taken from the same span of months from 2021 and it appears to be a steady climb upward. There are three horizontal bands. My net worth starts at the top of the first band on the first day and ends just above the third band on the last day.

The thing with the second image is that each band represents twice as much change than the first. So, if each band in the first image were 5 [.United States Dollars](USD) each band in the second image would be 10 USD.

Rendering charts can be difficult though and I don’t think there’s any manipulation happening here.

Designers often want to represent the highest-high and lowest low. Typically, we want to fill the screen. We want to trust that viewers will look at the scale and see the shifts, while visually dramatic represent only a fraction of the overall net worth and change over time.

Granted, most of this upward movement is because I’m still putting money in; the value of the portfolio is down a few thousand dollars compared to the cost basis.

The third image shows the time from just before I started tracking in [Personal Capital](https://www.personalcapital.com) up to June of this year. There are three bands, each representing a third of my net worth. The initial spike is from setting up and syncing my accounts. The steady climb that follows is primarily from my contributions; it’s too early for the effects of compounding and increased valuation to really take hold. The vertical line represents January first of 2022; when the volatility struck. And, for me, this where the plateau started. Further, this chart doesn’t seem nearly as scary as the first or as demotivating as the second.

## Future things

I’m considering expanding the breakdown for the components. It would use the `meter` element from [.hypertext markup language](HTML) to make it feel a bit more graphic, while maintaining the accessibility, which is important.

As I was thinking about the meter bit, I got to thinking I could include the value, growth, and core breakdown for the equities portion.

I’m not sure I want to add that level of complexity and bookkeeping though. The justification would need to go beyond these entries. I’m also not sure how much value it’d bring to readers or myself, to be fair.

To be honest I was thinking of getting rid of the breakdown entirely, but I do find it somewhat helpful on my end and it does guide my investment decisions. Just not sure the same would happen for the value, growth, and core components.

Maybe I’ll see how switching to using meters looks and revisit the idea.

## FI experiments 

Details are in the [January 15th, 2022 paycheck](https://joshbruce.com/finances/building-wealth-paycheck-to-paycheck/20220115/#fi-experiments).

The hypothesis is when the Mark 0.0 mix is down, it‘ll be down more than the others. Further, when the Mark 0.0 is up, the others will be up and not too far behind the Mark 0.0. We will track the change since the previous paycheck as well as the change since we started tracking January 2022.
