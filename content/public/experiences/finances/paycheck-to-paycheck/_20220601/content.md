# June 1st, 2022 paycheck

{!! dateblock !!}

{!! data !!}

Keeping the 401k at 17 percent. The bonus with this check did help put me back on track with just hitting the maximum by the end of the year.

We’ll see how it goes.

## Rough ride

The extended market fund is only down 30 percent from its 52 week high, so, I threw in extra in that fund.

If I’m thinking about this correctly, and if things stay on this plateau, toward the end of the year I shouldn’t be able to put extra in because both funds will be down over 30 percent compared to their 52 week high.

## Odd place

Still in the odd place a little bit but I can feel myself bouncing back. A lot is moving around and mostly for the better. For the pieces that I’m not sure are moving toward the better, I could be (and hope I am) wrong.

## Surgery

The human body is fascinating. 

The first week every time I sneezed or coughed it felt the way I’ve heard getting shot feels. The second week was better. Going into the third week I was feeling pretty good; it only hurt when particularly straining the muscles. 

I put a little extra into the Runway for when the hospital bills come rolling in. I know roughly how much it will be from checking the app for my health insurance.

## FI experiments

Details are in the [January 15th, 2022 paycheck](https://joshbruce.com/finances/building-wealth-paycheck-to-paycheck/20220115/#fi-experiments).

The hypothesis is when the Mark 0.0 mix is down, it‘ll be down more than the others. Further, when the Mark 0.0 is up, the others will be up and not too far behind the Mark 0.0. We will track the change since the previous paycheck as well as the change since we started tracking January 2022.
