# June 1st, 2022 paycheck

{!! dateblock !!}

{!! data !!}

Received a bonus this paycheck. 

Despite the bonus I decided to do a normal distribution this check. I know the hospital bills are going to be coming in shortly. Of course, they need to go to insurance first. My insurance is a high deductible plan, so, I’ll be paying most of it out of pocket. I will be saving the receipts though for use against my [.Health Savings Account](HSA), if necessary. 

## Surgery

Recovering pretty well. 

Until the 16th of May I pretty much just lied in bed. I was taking ibuprofen every six hours. I’d get up regularly to walk and whatnot.

As of May 28th, I can move pretty normally. I’m avoiding picking at the sites, which also means the surgical glue is still holding on a bit. My body hair is growing back, which is causing some interesting sensations there with the glue.

## Advisor report 

Had my follow-up with the advisor from [Personal Capital](https://www.personalcapital.com). This is my second consultation with an advisor in general. 

It was reaffirming and I decided against taking them on as my advisors and planners.

[My investment policy statement](/experiences/finances/investment-policy/) as of this writing shoots for an expense ratio of 0.5 or less; Personal Capital is 0.89 for the entire portfolio and 0.49 if I wanted them to just do my 401k. As of this writing my portfolio is valued at six figures, so, every year I’d pay Personal Capital 1,000 [.United States Dollars](USD) to take on the burden of portfolio management for me. Further, as the value goes up (or down) so does the amount I pay them.

There’s a certain amount of logic here. The more money I make, the more money they make. The less money I make, the less money they make. With that said, it requires both of us to navigate my baggage; of course, not all baggage is bad.

I grew up upper-lower class and lower-middle class. Even when the household income was upper-middle class, it didn’t feel like it. When I got on my own I was poor and in debt. Part of the baggage that’s unfair is taking advice that I probably could have done without.

Go to college, because more income. Don’t worry about the center, because employers just want to see you went. Get out of debt before thinking about retirement. And similar.

The advice came from multiple sources over multiple years. It’s on me that I listened to the advice without due diligence. We also can’t change the past, only determine how to progress into the future.

So, let’s progress.









I decided not to take them in as my financial advisors; to be fair they would have had to do something pretty special for me to say yes. They’re retirement number was 800,000 [.United States Dollars](USD), which is close to what I have at the moment. The advisor also asked a question I hadn’t really considered before: What are you using as a benchmark? I stumbled through a response that equated to: I don’t have one because it’s hard.

The first part of the call wasn’t mainly looking at where I was, which I can get from the dashboard. Roughly 33 percent in each market-cap. The recommendation was to be about 60, 20, 20 in large, mid, and small, respectively. 60-20-20 could be achieved with a total stock market fund along with a small-cap fund; of course, this wouldn’t give you the exact internal allocation of what Personal Capital is offering.

I explained the reasons I had for the market-cap weighting strategy I am using.

Then we talked about sector weighting; the recommendation was roughly even distribution across the sectors. Admittedly I’m not weighted as evenly as I’d like, however, my expense ratio at the moment is 0.04 percent. Meanwhile, if you did a 50-50 total stock market and small-cap value, it’d put the sector allocations closer to equal. With that said, my current allocation is more evenly distributed than the standard total stock market, which is almost 25 percent technology; my allocation is around 20 percent.

Regarding the benchmark question I think I’d have to see how Personal Capital’s [Smart Weighting](https://www.personalcapital.com/wealth-management/smart-weighting) performs, because I haven’t found a single fund (or index) that tries to do what they (and I) are doing. Beyond that, I look at the benchmarks provided by Personal Capital, the comparison between Personal Capital’s You Index (based on my linked accounts) and their recommendation, and how well I sleep at night.

## FI experiments 

Details are in the [January 15th, 2022 paycheck](https://joshbruce.com/finances/building-wealth-paycheck-to-paycheck/20220115/#fi-experiments).

The hypothesis is when the Mark 0.0 mix is down, it‘ll be down more than the others. Further, when the Mark 0.0 is up, the others will be up and not too far behind the Mark 0.0. We will track the change since the previous paycheck as well as the change since we started tracking January 2022.
