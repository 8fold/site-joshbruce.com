# May 15th, 2022 paycheck

{!! dateblock !!}

{!! data !!}

Received a bonus this paycheck. 

Despite the bonus I decided to do a normal distribution this check. I know the hospital bills are going to be coming in shortly. Of course, they need to go to insurance first. My insurance is a high deductible plan, so, I’ll be paying most of it out of pocket. I will be saving the receipts though for use against my [.Health Savings Account](HSA), if necessary. 



## Surgery

Recovering pretty well. 

Until the 16th of May I pretty much just lied in bed. I was taken ibuprofen every six hours. I’d get up regularly to walk and whatnot.

## FI experiments 

Details are in the [January 15th, 2022 paycheck](https://joshbruce.com/finances/building-wealth-paycheck-to-paycheck/20220115/#fi-experiments).

The hypothesis is when the Mark 0.0 mix is down, it‘ll be down more than the others. Further, when the Mark 0.0 is up, the others will be up and not too far behind the Mark 0.0. We will track the change since the previous paycheck as well as the change since we started tracking January 2022.
