# July 15th, 2022 paycheck

{!! dateblock !!}

{!! data !!}

Extended market fund is still down around 30 percent from its 52 week high, so, not putting money there. The multi-factor fund is almost at its minimum for the portfolio. I’m still buying the dip using the total stock market fund, which should be pushing the large-cap portion up a bit.

I’m noticing the small-cap value portion of the portfolio is holding pretty steady at 9 percent, which is what we were hoping for.

I started a new job and should be able to explore the world employee stock purchase plans.

## Adjusting tolerances

After adding the [inner bands](/experiences/finances/paycheck-to-paycheck/20220701/#adjusting-tolerances), I have a rebalancing token. Given I’m still able to impact the portfolio value by about 1 percent with every contribution and it’s not very far beyond the inner band, I doubt I’ll be doing any rebalancing in July.

## The plateau

Yep, it’s still a plateau. Even with the surgery my net worth is still hovering around what it been since the beginning of 2022; it’s actually a little higher, just not the steady incline I saw in 2021. 

## FI experiments

Details are in the [January 15th, 2022 paycheck](https://joshbruce.com/finances/building-wealth-paycheck-to-paycheck/20220115/#fi-experiments).

The hypothesis is when the Mark 0.0 mix is down, it‘ll be down more than the others. Further, when the Mark 0.0 is up, the others will be up and not too far behind the Mark 0.0. We will track the change since the previous paycheck as well as the change since we started tracking January 2022.
