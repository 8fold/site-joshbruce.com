# November 15th, 2021 paycheck

{!!dateblock!!}

{!!data!!}

Forgot to finish doing the needful on this one apparently; specifically, forgot to actually pay the credit cards, which is why the debt figure is as high as it is.

Still waiting on the [.IRS](Internal Revenue Service). Still bummed I couldn’t take advantage of the market being down because I felt like I needed to hold the cash. Given I have enough cash to pay the reported amount, I’ll probably start putting money toward investing again.

I’m becoming disappointed in the spreadsheet again, mainly the first step of determining the initial paycheck distribution. I’ll need to do something there. I have the itch to get out of the spreadsheet entirely. Not sure what that looks like at the moment.
