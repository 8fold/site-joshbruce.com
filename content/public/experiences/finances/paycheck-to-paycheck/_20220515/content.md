# May 15th, 2022 paycheck

{!! dateblock !!}

{!! data !!}

Sold more of the large-cap in the 401k to purchase more of the mid-cap. The current values for all three funds seem close enough to say that rebalancing is complete. After this paycheck I’m going to shift to an even distribution across all three funds for future contributions.

I didn’t put money into savings this time. The total [.United States](US) stock market fund is down 15 percent, so, I took the 15 percent plus what I’d normally invest; per [my personal budget](/experiences/finances/personal-budget/) for buying a dip.

The portfolio balance, based on individual funds (not the same as allocations used for the list above), is in balance. Need more total market and less extended market to get closer to the targets; the middle point between the guardrails. Once that happens, we can take a look at the Personal Capital grid and start shifting things; if I don't go in to the new fund a bit early.

Right now the grid is about the same as the [previous paycheck](/experiences/finances/paycheck-to-paycheck/20220501/#portfolio-balance-overall). A bit heavy on growth, and will likely stay that way by the time I get where I want to be with the percentage-based allocations for individual funds. So, June or July I'll decide whether to introduce the multi-factor fund.

I’ve never bought an [.exchange trade fund](ETF) through Vanguard. Further, Vanguard doesn’t allow partial shares. Finally, Fidelity does allow partial shares and the ability to purchase non-Fidelity funds commission free. Therefore, I’m debating on going through Fidelity for the multi-factor fund; however, I’m also considering going through Vanguard.

Going through Vanguard would mean I need to purchase full shares of the ETF. ETFs tend to carry some tax advantages over mutual funds because the realized gains and losses will be tied directly to my buying and selling. I’m debating on converting the mutual funds to a blend of ETFs and mutual funds for the same general holding.

## Rough ride

This is an interesting time, the bumpiest for me so far.

The extended market funds have dropped 30 percent from their 52 week highs, so, no more shoveling that direction.

The total small-cap and non-US real estate has almost had the same level of drop. 

I have rebalancing tokens for all the asset allocations except the Mark 0 mix in my [investment policy](/experiences/finances/investment-policy/#asset-allocation). We’ll see what July brings.

With that said, overall, 2022 is still looking more like a plateau than a dip for me. And, even with that observation, the net worth of my portfolio is less than my capital investment in it. Such is the way of things.

## Odd place

Definitely feeling better.

I’ve actually had more recruiters and leads than ever. It’s quite a strange and interesting feeling.

I’m also feeling like the relationship rotation thing is working out.

I’ve modified my weekly review a bit. Before I had a calendar event set up as the tickler. I’d open the event and translate the content to my [actions list](/examinations/getting-things-done/). Now I’m using the Reminders app and seeing how that goes; think I’ll always have a notebook as well though.

When I was in graduate school for secondary education I had to get observation hours by going to schools and, well, observing classes. One school I went to almost didn’t let me come back because I used my phone for note taking and whatnot. The perception was I was playing games or sending text messages; not what I was actually doing. This was around 2010 though, so, not sure the stigma is still there. However, handwriting is faster for me compared to data entry on my phone.

So, if it’s something that must be done on a certain date, it goes on the calendar. If it’s a recurring, tickler type thing, it goes in the Reminders app. Everything else will most likely be in a notebook somewhere.
