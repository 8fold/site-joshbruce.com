# May 25th, 2022 paycheck

{!! dateblock !!}

{!! data !!}

Believe I did the final sell-to-but rebalancing in the 401k. The current values for all three funds are relatively similar. I’m going to shift to roughly even distribution across all three from the contributions made.

## Portfolio balance overall 

## Odd place

Definitely feeling better.

I’ve actually had more recruiters and leads than ever. It’s quite a strange and interesting feeling.

I’m also feeling like the relationship rotation thing is working out.

I’ve also modified my weekly review a bit. Before I had a calendar event set up as the tickler. I’d open the event and translate the content to my actions list. Now I’m using the Reminders app and seeing how that goes. I don’t think I’ll ever abandon the notebook or notebook-like setup though. 

When I was in graduate school for secondary education I had to get observation hours by going schools and, well, observing classes. On school I went to almost didn’t let me come back because I used my phone for note taking and whatnot. The perception was that I was playing games or sending text messages; not what I was actually doing. This was around 2010 though, so, not sure the stigma is still there. However, handwriting is still faster for me compared to data entry in my phone.

So, if it’s something that must be done on a certain date, it goes on the calendar. If it’s a recurring, tickler type thing, it goes in the Reminders app. Everything else will most likely be in a notebook somewhere.
