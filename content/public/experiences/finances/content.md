# Finances

{!!dateblock!!}

I'm not financially ambitious and haven't had a record of earning money; however, I'm pretty good at allocating money when I have it.

I focus a lot on character and culture; values, principles, practices, and tools. This page describes my financial character, which is parter of the broader [personal character](/experiences/the-self/).

## Values

1. The most constrained over the most funded.
2. United States over International.
3. Passive management over
    - passive investing over
    - active investing over
    - active management.
4. Index funds over
    - individual stocks over
    - bonds.
5. Equities (ownership) over bonds (lending).
6. Small, local businesses over
    - large, multinational businesses over
    - local governments over
    - state governments over
    - federal governments.
7. Cooperative business structures over
    - privately held over
    - publicly traded.
8. Time in the market over timing the market.
9. Being in the market over beating the market.

## Principles

1. Corporate profits favor owners; owning equity shares makes you an owner of the company.
2. The borrower is slave to the lender; owning bonds makes you the lender to the government or corporation.
3. Dividends created in a security don't need to compound in that security.
4. If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.
5. Rising tides lift all boats and don't get caught skinny dipping during when they recede.
6. Money is food, not blood.
7. The macro-allocation principle.

## Practices

1. Maximize revenue, minimize spending, save and invest the gap.
2. Combined expense ratio less than 1%.
5. Pay yourself first.
6. Promote dividends earned in securities returning less than 7% per year to securities that historically return higher.
7. Higher rates of return should be lowest priority consideration when making decisions (see previous).
8. [Building Wealth Paycheck to Paycheck](/experiences/finances/paycheck-to-paycheck/).
9. [Personal budget](/experiences/finances/personal-budget/).
9. No leveraged investing.
10. No shorting stocks.

## Tools

1. [Personal Capital](https://www.personalcapital.com) for tracking the majority of my portfolio; some providers canâ€™t be linked, but it gets me close enough. In particular I appreciate the "You Index" and "Asset Allocation" tools.
2. [Wave](https://www.waveapps.com) for personal and business accounting.
3. [Stripe](https://stripe.com) and [Square](https://squareup.com/us/en) for payment processing, appointments, and the like.
4. One insured spending account: All non-business outflows come from this account.
5. One or more federally insured, interest bearing savings accounts.
6. One or more regulated retirement accounts.
7. One or more regulated taxable accounts.
8. A well-maintained [investment policy](/experiences/finances/investment-policy/).
