# My productivity system

I'm going to describe how I get stuff done. Writing it down like this is a somewhat morbid task as this post is doubling as a way for someone to come in and take over if I'm incapacitated in some way.

The tools are less important than the capabilities afforded by them.

For the most part I use the free applications provided by Apple. I consider the cost of the software to be part of the premium paid for by the hardware and the applications are pretty easy to use.

## Calendar app

I use Apple's Calendar app to track scheduled events; I try to minimize having recurring events listed here, which is different than my work calendar. It's available on all my devices and in iCloud, which keeps the events synced across all my devices; though this can get sketchy on occasion.

The events may be things that *must* be done on that date and at that time, or, they may be agreements I've made with someone else that can be renegotiated.

A semipermeable hard landscape; somewhere between the calendar described by [*The 7 Habits book*](/examinations/the-7-habits-of-highly-effective-people/) and the one described by [*Getting Things Done*](/examinations/getting-things-done/).

I use multiple calendars within the app.

- I have a shareable calendar I use for most of my events, which I can share with friends and family. 
- Becca has shared her calendar with me as well, which lets me see her schedule of things; similar to my shareable calendar.
- Becca and I have a calendar that is for events where the two of us will be involved or needed.

These are the main calendars and the others may come and go.

I also use the Calendar app to remind me of people's birthdays, which are stored with their contact information in the Contacts app; more on that later.

This is the app I want to look at first on most days because it shows the somewhat hard landscape of my world.

## Reminders app

I use Apple's Reminders app as my tickler file; mentioned in *Getting Things Done*. It's available on all my Apple devices and through the iCloud website, which keeps the reminders synced across all my devices.

Reminders are placed in lists and lists can be grouped together. There are a lot of other features, but these are the two I use most often.

The vast majority of reminders are set to repeat, which is easier done using an app than with pen and paper because every time I mark the reminder as done it sets itself to go off again at a later date.

This is the app I check after looking at the Calendar app; mainly for the automatically generated "Today" list, which shows all items due that day or that are past due.

I use this app for most things maintenance. I should note, with most of these, I don't need to wait *until* the date to perform the associated action. Instead these reminders act as, well, reminders; an accountability partner poking their head up and saying, "Hey, just in case you haven't done it already, you should do this thing."

What I appreciate here is the "set it and forget it" nature of things. Once I put the reminder in the app and set the interval, I can look at the Today list and work off that instead of digging through all the lists individually.

Let's look at some of these in more detail.

### The Rotation

Growing up in a military family we moved a lot. Whenever we did I'd get contact information for friends and family in that place. Despite both of us promising to keep in touch, we never did. I would inevitably apologize when I would get back in touch with someone, usually with self-deprecating humor: I'm a terrible friend.

Just before 2020 I started becoming disenchanted with social media. I was also becoming frustrated with trying to build relationships in those environments. When the 2020 pandemic started I decided to create a system to help me out.

The Rotation is a list in the Reminders app.

Each reminder is the name of a person with whom I have taken on the responsibility of reaching out to on a regular basis to keep in touch in a more intimate way than, "What do you mean you didn't see my post on social media?"

**How it started:** I looked at the Contacts app and my social media accounts and started reaching out to folks to have a catch-up conversation. Based on how that went, I would fill them in on what I was doing and I'd ask if they wanted to be on the rotation. And, if so, how often did they want to hang out and talk. Then I'd create a reminder and set that time period as the interval; could be as short as one month all the way up to a year—haven't had anyone go beyond one year.

**How it's going:** When their name pops up on the Today list, I send them a message using their preferred method, which is captured with their contact information in the Contacts app. The message is asking if and when they want to have a catch up conversation; this is the first step to marking the reminder done. Once we figure out a date and time, I create an event in the Calendar app; this may shift, but it's the second step toward marking the reminder done. When we actually have the call, I update the reminder with *that* date, and mark the reminder complete; this ensures we don't end up in a situation where we talk and the next day I'm sending them a message to catch up again—the interval is maintained based on the last time we talked.

There's also no rule, edict, or custom that says I have to always be the one to initiate; in one case, as of this writing, a friend has taken on the task of reaching out to me instead of me reaching out to them. We also don't need to wait the entire duration; the other day a friend called out of the blue and we caught up then. The interval is a rough maximum, not a minimum and I'm agreeing to be the one to reach out if things go quiet for a while.

I'm building the list slowly. In some cases it's folks I knew in my primary and secondary school days and ran into online. In others it's people I've worked with in the past. I'm also looking at folks I've only known through social media and seeing if they want to try and have a relationship outside the Internet.

Some people are only meant to be "Facebook friends" and there's nothing wrong with that.

### The reviews

This is a group of lists in the Reminders app and it stores the recurring maintenance tasks.

I have a list for:

1. weekly,
2. monthly,  
3. quarterly, and
4. annually.

These names are something of misnomers. The weekly, for example, is really less than a month, so, things that are done every other week are listed here as well.

Paydays and paying bills go in the weekly list. Downloading statements and reconciling accounts go on the monthly lists. Reconciling the 401k account is an exception because I do that quarterly because it's easier that way. Testing the batteries in my tracking devices is in the quarterly list. Stuff related to taxes are in the annual list.

Some of the reminders have their dates modified based on when I actually get them done. Others works a bit different because there's a specific date at which I should start thinking about them each interval.

### Shopping

The shopping list is an exception to the guideline of the reminders being recurring maintenance tasks. I typically have one of my AirPods in my ear and, when I notice I'm running low on something, I'll ask Siri to add an item to my shopping list. Then, when I go shopping, it's all right there in the app on my phone.

### Shared lists

Becca and I have some shared lists as well that we can use as ticklers to talk about later or coordinate around a particular event. When my mother passed away, for example, Becca, my sister, and I created a shared Reminders list because we all use Apple devices and it made things easier to track.

### Miscellaneous

I have various other lists that I use as a way to capture things outside the main action list I use. They sorta fall into the "someday/maybe" category from *Getting Things Done*; part of what I call The Forge.

## The Forge and Crucible

The Forge is the generic name I give to things I'm just sorta thinking about doing; these may never happen and may be removed, but I get them out of my head. The Crucible is reserved for things I'm actively pursuing, near-term. 

Most of my near-term, one-off actions goes into a notebook; paper or digital. With either version I try to distinguish between three roles. With the paper notebook, I use different color inks. With the digital notebook, I use different line weights.

1. Personal: black, thin.
2. Professional: varies, medium.
3. Employment (or client): green, thick.

I do this because it helps me see, at a glance, where I might be falling behind or where things might be backing up a bit.

## Contacts app

I use Apple's Contacts app to store contact information and related details for individuals; however, it's becoming way more than that. 

I take notes about people, have their birthdays there, which also appear on my calendar; instead of depending on social media platforms to let me know.

It's a very capable app. Every time I think about getting a fully-fledged relationship management software, I try to see if I can accomplish something similar with what I have, and I haven't found the combination of the Contacts app and the other free apps listed so far lacking in that regard.

## Notes app

I use Apple's Notes app for many things. Mainly I track my online accounts, share notes with Becca for a regular check-in she and I have, scan documents, and, well, taking notes.

I have a bunch of notes that are pinned and locked. They store lists of all my online accounts. As soon as I sign up for one, or, let's be honest, discover I had an account within something I forgot about, I put it on a list in one of these pinned and locked notes. I have a monthly reminder set to go through the list and delete things, update passwords, and so on. 

Becca and I share a note of topics to discuss during a weekly check-in we've set up with each other to handle the business part of partnership.

## Mail app

I use Apple's Mail app for consolidating all of my email accounts into one email client. The major affordances I appreciate here are the rules, the ability to mark some addresses as being very important people, and the integration with the other apps (which has actually been the biggest surprise with the suite of productivity apps from Apple).

Despite rules being available in most email clients, in this case, I have to say none of the clients I've used has had the same robust and easy to use system I've experienced with Apple Mail. I have rules that automatically delete emails from recruiters when I'm not actively looking for a job; when I am, I just turn that rule off and I see their emails again. If I sign up for a newsletter or some other recurring mailer, I'll create a rule that automatically routes it to a folder for future reading; if I unsubscribe later, the rule is still there and I don't get a cluttered inbox. I even have rules that color-code emails; green for finance-related things and red for stuff using deprecated email addresses. But, the big thing for me is the simplicity of it. For example, if I'm looking at an email for a newsletter I've signed up for that I don't have a rule for, when I create the rule, the app uses the email I'm currently viewing to auto-populate the form fields; move stuff from this address to that folder—the from address will be pre-filled with the sender of the currently selected email.

The very important people feature is basically a rule as well, but there's a shorthand way of creating it. Instead of creating a rule that says, "If sender is X, do this thing." You click a star in the interface and when emails come in from that address again, they will be highlighted with a star; these are the only emails I let pop notification on my phone.

Regarding the integration it's kinda trippy to drag emails over to Notes or Reminders and have the app actually being able to do something there. Calendar can pick up on possible invites in emails. That sorta thing.
