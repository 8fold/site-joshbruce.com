# Investing

For me, I’m fond of the principles espoused by Bogle and Dalio. Further, I’m appreciating the 10 question approach proposed by the book *Money for the Rest of Us*. Finally, I’m seeing the benefit of a risk parity approach to investing in drawdown.

## The principles 

We’re looking at 3 principles:

1. the macro-allocation principle,
2. The Holy Grail of Investing (principle), and
3. the simplicity principle.

The macro-allocation principle says that portfolios made of similar asset classes in similar proportions will act over 90 percent the same. All 100 percent stock portfolios will act over 90 percent the same, for example. This means any changes we make to proportions within that portfolio are somewhat moot when it comes to returns, gains, losses, and so on.

The Holy Grail of Investing says that asset classes have an environment in which they perform best. Consider a quad chart. The first column is an inflationary environment where the purchasing power of a currency reduces. The second column is a deflationary environment. The top row is a growth environment. The bottom row is a compressing environment. What we want to do, according to this principle, is to choose asset classes that perform well in each environment and then set proportions accordingly. In general, this means equities, bonds, gold, and something like commodities (or literally commodities). The key is that each asset class should have low- or negative-correlation with the others.

The simplicity principle basically says we want to be abide by the previous 2 principles with a minimal number of individual vehicles and fees.

During accumulation mode where you’re not planning to shift to drawdown with the next 10 or more years chances are the best bet will be to have a 100 percent equities portfolio; this ensures maximum return for the money you’re putting in, however, opens you up to risk regarding drops in value. 

When it comes to shifting toward drawdown we want to add bonds that are negatively correlated with equities. For example, long-term treasuries (in the United States), which have a negative 0.31 correlation to equities on a scale of negative 1 to positive 1, so, when equities drop, treasuries tend to go up in value. Gold has roughly a 0 correlation with equities and treasuries. Commodities are about 0.5 correlated and tend to do better during inflationary environments.

With the above, you could get that result with 4 different securities; simple.

## 10 questions 

1. What is it?
2. Is it investing, speculating, or gambling?
3. What’s the upside?
4. What’s the downside?
5. Who’s on the other side of the trade?
6. What’s the investment vehicle?
7. What does it take to be successful?
8. Who’s getting a cut?
9. How does it impact your portfolio?
10. Should you invest?

What I appreciate about this approach is that it helps cover the age-old advice (another principle) of don’t buy into things you don’t understand.

Let’s take VTSAX in 100 percent equities portfolio.

1. Broad-based equities.
2. Investing: it pays dividends and may increase or decrease in value over time.
3. It invests in all stocks available in the New York Stock Exchange, therefore, the likelihood of going to 0 is minimal and, if it does, there are probably bigger concerns than the value of my portfolio. It pays dividends on a fairly regular basis. Vanguard is owned by its investors. VTSAX is a long-running, well-known, and relatively liquid security. And so on. 
4. It could lose value compared to what I’ve put in and could take a long time to recover. And so on. 
5. It’s passively managed by Vanguard.
6. Index mutual fund; I’m investing in Vanguard as much as the companies underlying the fund.
7. Does better in growth environments and favors large-cap companies.
8. Vanguard takes a percentage for passive management of the fund. The expense ratio as of this writing is 0.04 percent per year. This percent is converted to a daily percent and the gains and losses are adjusted by that percent daily.
9. Because it’s 100 percent of the portfolio, it is the portfolio.
10. I’m in accumulation mode with more than 10 years before needing to withdraw, so, pretty easy to say yes here.

It’s important to note that the majority of responses are not based on emotion. With that said, adding in more emotional considerations are inherently a problem.

For example, I tend to favor even distribution across small-, mid-, and large-cap companies when it comes to investing in the United States stock market. VTSAX favors large-cap companies. So, I added other funds that afford me the opportunity to distribute my contributions more evenly; despite the downside of slightly increasing expense ratios and complexity as well as knowing the portfolios will perform pretty similarly. In other words, the change isn’t because I think my mix will outperform anything; it makes me feel better.

## Risk parity portfolios

A risk parity portfolio could be viewed as the natural result of The Holy Grail of Investing.

Let’s consider the Mark 1 portfolio I’m planning to head toward over the years as I steadily move toward drawdown [paycheck-by-paycheck](/finances/building-wealth-paycheck-to-paycheck/).

50 percent total [.United States](US) equities, 25 percent long-term US treasuries, 13 percent gold, 6 percent commodities, 3 percentUS [.real estate investment trust](REIT), and 3 percent non-US REIT.

A simple path to get there would be:

1. VTSAX,
2. VLGSX,
3. GLDM,
4. PDBC,
5. VGSLX, and
6. VGRLX.

Vanguard doesn’t offer a gold or commodities fund with similar performance to GLDM and PDBC and that’s okay. 

I don’t want the mix provided by VTSAX alone, so, I’ll add a seventh fund: VEXAX.

In some cases, I don’t have the ability to purchase into the index fund at Vanguard or I just want to purchase using a different tool, which brings in [.Exchange Traded Funds](ETFs). Mutual funds typically have minimum initial deposit requirements and must be done directly with the company offering the fund. ETFs are a way to purchase shares in index funds outside of the institution. Performance characteristics are typically similar and there are details we won’t go into related to the concept of fractional shares. This gives us a list of mix-and-match securities:

1. VTSAX, VTI;
2. VEXAX, VXF;
3. VLGSX, VGLT;
4. GLDM;
5. PDBC;
6. VGSLX, VNQ; and
7. VGRLX, VNQI.

When it comes to certain things, I can’t stick to Vanguard, so, I’ll look for the equivalent index at the provider in question. For example, my employer uses Fidelity. Fidelity offers [.Health Savings Accounts](HSA) and Vanguard doesn’t and I had a fallout with HealthSavings Administrators, so, my HSA is with Fidelity, bringing in another fund:

1. VTSAX, VTI;
2. VEXAX, VXF, FSMAX;
3. VLGSX, VGLT;
4. GLDM;
5. PDBC;
6. VGSLX, VNQ; and
7. VGRLX, VNQI.

Unfortunately, these aren’t available for my 401k, so, 3 more funds:

1. VTSAX, VTI;
2. VEXAX, VXF, FSMAX;
3. FXAIX;
4. FSMDX;
5. FSSNX;
6. VLGSX, VGLT;
7. GLDM;
8. PDBC;
9. VGSLX, VNQ; and
10. VGRLX, VNQI.

This seems like it’s breaking the simplicity principle, but the simplicity is in the macro-allocation. The rest happens due to other constraints and opportunities to achieve the macro-allocation.
