# Budgeting

{!!dateblock!!}

> I'm working on updating the structure and format of the site. Part of this change is separating the experiences and experiments (how I'm doing things) from the more informational aspects. So, if you're looking for information, you can find that over at the under construction [essays and editorials](/essays-and-editorials/finances/budgeting/) area.

This is an evergreen post describing how I currently handle my budgeting.

## Income

I various streams of income, which I separate between:

- W2 Employment, 
- W2 Bonuses, 
- Credit card rewards - non-taxable,
- Credit card rewards - bonuses - non-taxable,
- Sales, and
- and Misc. (1099).

The first two are the more generic categories for W2 employment; my day job(s). The second two are related to credit cards, which I tend to use for cash back and they are labeled non-taxable as a hint to myself and tax professionals that these should not be considered part of my regular income; they are more like rebates. Sales is there for when I sell products I create or things I own. And, the last bucket is for work I do as a 1099 and similar.

## Expenses

I'm not going to list all of my categories here, though the list is short.

I have education and entertainment. When I buy books I'm wanting to learn something from, it's education. When I buy books and movies for their entertainment value, it's entertainment. If I go to a movie, it's entertainment. If I take a class on some topic, it's education.

Similarly I have a single electronics category. This category includes equipment purchases; like cellphone, laptop, and so on. Further, it includes related maintenance fees; like cellphone service, cloud storage, and the like. These are services related to the desired, smooth operation of the electronics. One category—not a separate category for everything. (I do the same with the housing category.)

Food, on the other hand, I have broken down into three categories. There's food, which are groceries and food related to at home meal preparation. There's food-dining, which is when I order out. And there's food-snacks, which is things like candy bars and whatnot. It's worth nothing that if I buy snacks at the grocery store, it just falls under the more generic food. 

Not micro-managing the categories. I want a few categories so I can see where most of the money is going from glancing at the pie chart created by [Wave](https://www.waveapps.com).

I also have the miscellaneous category, which handles everything else. If the miscellaneous category becomes too large, I might look at the transactions and create a new category. For example, when I buy clothes, I mark it as a miscellaneous expense. If I start buying more clothes, more often I might create a clothing category for a while to see if this is a new habit that will continue into the future, or, if it was just a short-term thing. If it turns out to be a short-term thing, I'll go back to using the miscellaneous category.

There are some things I just want to track to make sure I'm not going a little crazy on certain things. For example, I still smoke tobacco. I have a habit-tobacco category just for when I purchase tobacco products. This is also part of the visualization nature of budgeting. By seeing it, I can determine is the benefit worth that cost; financially and possibly from a health perspective. This category is a convenience and, if the belt needs tightening, I will reduce or cut it out. 

## Assets

This one will be a bit long because I want to break down the why a bit.

Part of my [personal character](/about/) is, never enter anything without an exit strategy. Part of my [financial character](/finances/) is, to favor cooperative structures over private businesses over publicly traded businesses. These are both reflected in my selection of institutions related to my asset accounts:

- Assets
	- Cash and banks
		- Primary credit union: A member-owned, not-for-profit financial institution.
		- Secondary credit union: Same as above.
		- Tertiary bank: A privately-owned, member bank, which is to say they have constraints on who can have accounts there.
	- Brokers
		- Primary broker: A shareholder owned brokerage firm; I buy the funds, I am a shareholder of the broker.
		- Secondary broker: A privately owned firm.
		- Tertiary broker: A privately owned firm, which I'm thinking of moving away from to try and simplify things a bit.

Most activity happens in the primary institutions. With that said, if I decide to leave an institution, like the tertiary broker, it's pretty easy to do so because I have already started and keep track of my relationship and feelings about the other institutions.

When it comes to liquid cash (bank accounts), I use a [fund accounting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fund_accounting) strategy inspired primarily by the book [*Profit First*](https://profitfirstbook.com). So, I have multiple sub-accounts, each with a specific purpose.

- Assets
	- Cash and banks
		- Primary credit union
			- Income: A spending account (checking) where all money received from third-parties goes; this starts the flow before money is transferred to other accounts.
			- Expenses: A spending account for paying expenses; usually these expenses are due each month or on shorter time-scales.
			- Investing pass-through: A spending account where money is transferred; this is the only account brokers can deposit and withdrawal to and from, respectively.
			- Runway: A savings account for future, known expenses; usually due within two to 12 months.
			- Savings: A savings account as an extension of the Runway *and* for taking advantage of long-term savings and investing opportunities, when available.
			- Taxes: A savings account where I set aside a certain percentage of each dollar of income incase I owe taxes at the end of the year.
		- Secondary credit union
			- Checking: Not really used, but it allows me to easily transfer money into the account from the Expenses account at the primary credit union.
			- Savings: Not really used, but required to open the account with the credit union.
		- Tertiary bank
			- Checking: Same as the secondary credit union checking account.
		- Digital wallet(s): Apple Cash, PayPal, and similar.
		- Cash on hand: Physical cash in my pockets, cookie jars, and the like.
	- Brokers
		- Primary broker
		- Secondary broker
		- Tertiary broker

Last we'll break down the brokerage accounts. Most of my investments are in index funds and there is a separate entry for each vehicle. By making these accounts, I can keep track of my cost basis; how much money I've put into each. I do not adjust for the daily valuation of the account. The transactions on these broker accounts for bookkeeping purposes are limited to purchases, exchanges, dividends, and realized capital gains and losses.

- Assets
	- Cash and banks
		- Primary credit union
			- Income
			- Expenses
			- Investing pass-through
			- Runway
			- Savings
			- Taxes
		- Secondary credit union
			- Checking
			- Savings
		- Tertiary bank
			- Checking
		- Digital wallet(s)
		- Cash on hand
	- Brokers
		- Primary broker
			- Taxable - settlement fund: Used to transfer money to and from the Investing pass-through account before buying more shares in the index fund(s) within the account.
			- Taxable - investment(s): Mostly index funds. There is a separate entry for each holding.
			- Traditional [.Individual Retirement Account](IRA) - settlement fund: Same as Taxable - settlement fund.
			- Traditional IRA - investment(s): Same as Taxable - investment(s).
			- Roth IRA - settlement fund: Same as Taxable - settlement fund.
			- Roth IRA - investment(s): Same as Taxable - investment(s).
		- Secondary broker
			- Taxable - settlement fund: Same as Primary broker.
			- Taxable - investment(s): Same as Primary broker.
			- 401k - investment(s): There is no settlement account here and there are separate entries for each investment inside the 401k. For bookkeeping purposes I separate my contributions from the employer match.
			- [.Health Savings Account](HSA) - cash account: Same as the various settlement funds. However, since this is an HSA where I can spend cash on doctors and whatnot, this also acts like a spending account. For my purposes though it's mainly a settlement fund.
		- Tertiary broker
			- Taxable - cash account: Same as settlement funds.
			- Taxable - investment(s): Same other investment accounts.

Each broker offers traditional and Roth IRAs and taxable accounts. The broker for my 401k was chosen by my employer; the Traditional IRA is the fallback. The HSA is sort of the odd one out because I'm not using the provider selected by my employer and I don't have a tertiary fallback.

So, without the notes: 

- Assets
	- Cash and banks
		- Primary credit union
			- Income
			- Expenses
			- Investing pass-through
			- Runway
			- Savings
			- Taxes
		- Secondary credit union
			- Checking
			- Savings
		- Tertiary bank
			- Checking
		- Digital wallet(s)
		- Cash on hand
	- Brokers
		- Primary broker
			- Taxable - settlement fund
			- Taxable - investment(s)
			- Traditional [.Individual Retirement Account](IRA) - settlement fund
			- Traditional IRA - investment(s)
			- Roth IRA - settlement fund
			- Roth IRA - investment(s)
		- Secondary broker
			- Taxable - settlement fund
			- Taxable - investment(s)
			- 401k - investment(s)
			- [.Health Savings Account](HSA) - cash account
		- Tertiary broker
			- Taxable - cash account
			- Taxable - investment(s)

You might be thinking this is complicated. And I would say with the apps that are available and how the accounts are actually, it doesn't feel that way; especially with the use of Wave, which I have syncing with the income and credit card accounts, which we'll get to later.

Most of the brokerage accounts, at this point, just receive money. So, I only mess around with them when I'm reconciling or rebalancing them.

The accounts at the secondary and tertiary institutions aren't really used.

That leaves the primary credit union. My paycheck goes into the income account. I use Wave and a spreadsheet to create a plan; usually takes about 15 minutes to create the plan and entries; the prepare part of the action loop. Then I spend another 45 minutes or so verifying transactions since the previous paycheck, transferring money, and making credit card payments.

Typically I'm only investing in one or two investments per paycheck, so, minimal activity there as well. 

## Liabilities

- Liabilities
	- Revolving loans (credit cards, lines of credit, and so on)
		- Primary credit union
			- Quaternary credit card: A low rate card with no rewards or similar program.
			- Line of credit: Used for overdraft protection on the checking account.
		- Secondary credit union
			- Primary credit card: A rewards card that has three percent cash back on the types of establishments I used most.
		- Tertiary bank
			- Secondary credit card: A rewards card that has one-point-five percent cash back on all purchases, which is what I use for items that don't have better rewards with the other cards.
		- Apple
			- Tertiary credit card: A rewards card that offers three percent cash back on Apple products and two percent cash back at places that accept Apply Pay.

I don't have any terminal loans anymore and I pay the cards off each month. Each card syncs automatically with Wave; except the Apple Card because it's not available like that yet. However, outside of subscriptions with Apple and apps it doesn't get used much. Updating the transactions for the Apple Card are part of the transaction refinement described in the Assets section.













## Distributions

Every paycheck, or every two weeks, I redistribute money; I only post here on the first and fifteenth though.

### Establishing the baseline

I don't remember the resource or resources I pulled this idea from; believe it was an episode of the [Choose FI podcast](https://www.choosefi.com/listen/choose-fi-podcast/). It goes like this, there are three types of expenses:

1. basic,
2. utility, and
3. convenience.

Basic expenses are those things that are required and tend to be fixed; keeping the lights on expenses. For example, you might consider house payments or rent to be basic.

It’s worth noting that required here is as much psychological as it may be literal. “If I want to keep X in my life, I need to spend Y” as opposed to, “I need to spend Y to survive.” Living in my car for a year quickly taught me the difference.

Utility are required expenses, however, may be less required than what you consider basic. Further, you have some control over how much you spend without changing providers or the item itself. For example, electricity, food, and taxes.

Convenience are expenses that add to your life and could be cut entirely or reduced dramatically. For example, insurance on electronics and some subscription services.

Capture all of these expenses along with:

1. how much the expense will be (even if an estimate),
2. how many paychecks will be received between payments, and
3. which type of expense it is.

Do this for each known future expense.

I have a cellphone I believe needs to be replaced every 4 or 5 years. The phone will be around 800 [.United States Dollars](USD), I will receive roughly 120 paychecks between replacements, and it's a basic expense. It's a basic expense because I consider communication to be a requirement and while I have flexibility in the phone I purchase, I plan on purchasing the same or similar phone as the one I have. The affordance of being able to make and receive phone calls is the requirement.

Coupled to the cellphone, I have a service plan. The amount is roughly 35 USD per month, I’ll receive at least 2 paychecks between statements, and it's a basic expense because for the phone to serve its required purpose it must have service.

I need food to survive. I spend anywhere from 50 to 70 USD per week on food, I'll receive 0.5 paychecks between replenishments, and I consider it a utility expense. I consider food to be a utility expense because within some range, I have the ability to control how much I spend per week on food; coupons, sales, member card discounts, just eating less, and so on.

In 2021 I spent 1,750 USD on tobacco products for the year, I’ll receive roughly 26 paychecks in a year, and I consider tobacco products to be a convenience expense.

Once you've got enough these known future expenses in place to have seated the habit of capturing them, determine how much per paycheck you'll set aside for each expense and where you'll put it.

If I'm planning to need the money in one year or less, I'll typically put it in the Runway account. Any longer than a year, it typically goes into an investment account of some sort.

The goal here is to know, roughly, what your minimum living expenses could be and establish a priority should things go pear-shaped.

For example, at present I have a laptop and a desktop computer. I set aside a certain amount per paycheck to replace both. I consider the laptop to be a utility expense while the desktop is a convenience. If things go sideways and it comes time to replace one, the other, or both, chances are I'd only replace the laptop. All of the money set aside for the smooth operation of my electronic hardware is placed in a conservative investment account because I plan on keeping each device for roughly 5 years.

### Preparing for known future expenses

With the aforementioned in place and money squirreled away to cover those known expenses, I'm ready to figure out distributions using [Wave](https://www.waveapps.com) to create a plan.

Every paycheck, I sum the total balance of each credit card I have and each bill that’s due. I make sure the Operating Expenses account will be left at around 100 USD after paying each credit card and bill. Sometimes this requires moving money from the Runway account; usually when paying rent or purchasing the item I had been preparing for.

I sum all the partial payments for known future expenses due within the next 12 months and put that in the Runway account.

I sum all known future expenses due after 12 months or more and put those into the conservative securities I have for each.

That covers short-term needs.

### Preparing for unknown future expenses

Making sure I can keep the lights on out of the way, time to move on to preparing for the known unknowns. (This could be called preparing for retirement.)

My employer is responsible for paying the majority of my taxes, however, I generate extra income from various sources including dividends on savings and investments. Therefore, I make sure I'm putting a bit aside to cover the possibility of owing taxes. As of this writing, I have 2 percent of each check going to the Tax account.

I distribute at least 100 USD up to the maximum cash percentage set by the asset allocation of the portfolio to Cash Reserves account.

Whatever remains goes toward the taxable brokerage account and Roth Individual Retirement Account.

## Transferring from the Tax account

The maximum transfer is 80 percent of the available balance. Transfers are made to the Cash Reserves account. The following criteria must be met:

1. taxes for the year were filed and accepted by the Government; and
2. if money is owed, it was paid out of the Tax account and received by the Government; or
3. if a refund is expected, it was received and deposited to the Income account and transferred to the Tax account.

This move puts money back into circulation within the system; see next section.

If money is owed, the amount sent to the Tax account must be increased by at least 1 percent.

If money is owed, and there isn't enough in the Tax account to cover the amount, cash should be withdrawn from the accounts in the following order:

1. Cash Reserves,
2. Runway.

If more money is needed, something has gone horribly wrong and you should be consulting with accountants and attorneys.

## Spending cash reserves

Cash reserves are different than an emergency fund in that cash reserves are there for times of opportunity while emergency funds are there for times of strife.

A portion of each paycheck is set aside for cash reserves; not to exceed the maximum cash reserve percent and it cannot cause the proportion of cash in the portfolio to go over the maximum cash allowed.

The following events open the possibility of spending cash reserves (or not setting aside a percentage):

<details>
<summary>Too much cash</summary>

Barring extenuating circumstances (like owing thousands of dollars), if the balance of cash reserves causes the cash portion of the portfolio to be higher than the maximum established, cash may be immediately spent to buy a single security in the portfolio.

</details>

<details>
<summary>90 day cool down</summary>

If it’s been 90 days since the last spend from cash reserves, up to 50 percent of the cash reserves balance can be used to buy a single security in the portfolio.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Buying a dip</summary>

If the current price of a security is 3–30 percent less than the 52 week high for that security, cash reserves may be used to purchase that security.

The percent of cash reserves that may be used is equal to the percent the security is down.

For example, if the security is down 5 percent, you may use up to 5 percent of the cash reserves to purchase the single security.

</details>

Constraints on how cash reserves may be spent:

1. Each spend can only be used to purchase one security.
2. Purchasing the security cannot put the portfolio out of balance.
3. There must be at least 7 days between spends, regardless of event timings.
4. If the current price of a security is down more than 30 percent of the 52 week high, cash reserves cannot be used to purchase that security.
