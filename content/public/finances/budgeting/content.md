# Budgeting

{!!dateblock!!}

> I'm working on updating the structure and format of the site. Part of this change is separating the experiences and experiments (how I'm doing things) from the more informational aspects. So, if you're looking for information, you can find that over at the under construction [essays and editorials](/essays-and-editorials/finances/budgeting/) area.

This is an evergreen post describing how I currently handle my budgeting.

## Income

I various streams of income, which I separate between:

- W2 Employment, 
- W2 Bonuses, 
- Credit card rewards - non-taxable,
- Credit card rewards - bonuses - non-taxable,
- Sales, and
- and Misc. (1099).

The first two are the more generic categories for W2 employment; my day job(s). The second two are related to credit cards, which I tend to use for cash back and they are labeled non-taxable as a hint to myself and tax professionals that these should not be considered part of my regular income; they are more like rebates. Sales is there for when I sell products I create or things I own. And, the last bucket is for work I do as a 1099 and similar.

## Expenses

I'm not going to list all of my categories here, though the list is short.

I have education and entertainment. When I buy books I'm wanting to learn something from, it's education. When I buy books and movies for their entertainment value, it's entertainment. If I go to a movie, it's entertainment. If I take a class on some topic, it's education.

Similarly I have a single electronics category. This category includes equipment purchases; like cellphone, laptop, and so on. Further, it includes related maintenance fees; like cellphone service, cloud storage, and the like. These are services related to the desired, smooth operation of the electronics. One category—not a separate category for everything. (I do the same with the housing category.)

Food, on the other hand, I have broken down into three categories. There's food, which are groceries and food related to at home meal preparation. There's food-dining, which is when I order out. And there's food-snacks, which is things like candy bars and whatnot. It's worth nothing that if I buy snacks at the grocery store, it just falls under the more generic food. 

Not micro-managing the categories. I want a few categories so I can see where most of the money is going from glancing at the pie chart created by [Wave](https://www.waveapps.com).

I also have the miscellaneous category, which handles everything else. If the miscellaneous category becomes too large, I might look at the transactions and create a new category. For example, when I buy clothes, I mark it as a miscellaneous expense. If I start buying more clothes, more often I might create a clothing category for a while to see if this is a new habit that will continue into the future, or, if it was just a short-term thing. If it turns out to be a short-term thing, I'll go back to using the miscellaneous category.

There are some things I just want to track to make sure I'm not going a little crazy on certain things. For example, I still smoke tobacco. I have a habit-tobacco category just for when I purchase tobacco products. This is also part of the visualization nature of budgeting. By seeing it, I can determine is the benefit worth that cost; financially and possibly from a health perspective. This category is a convenience and, if the belt needs tightening, I will reduce or cut it out. 

## Assets

This one will be a bit long because I want to break down the why a bit.

Part of my [personal character](/about/) is, never enter anything without an exit strategy. Part of my [financial character](/finances/) is, to favor cooperative structures over private businesses over publicly traded businesses. These are both reflected in my selection of institutions related to my asset accounts:

- Assets
	- Cash and banks
		- Primary credit union: A member-owned, not-for-profit financial institution.
		- Secondary credit union: Same as above.
		- Tertiary bank: A privately-owned, member bank, which is to say they have constraints on who can have accounts there.
	- Brokers
		- Primary broker: A shareholder owned brokerage firm; I buy the funds, I am a shareholder of the broker.
		- Secondary broker: A privately owned firm.
		- Tertiary broker: A privately owned firm, which I'm thinking of moving away from to try and simplify things a bit.

Most activity happens in the primary institutions. With that said, if I decide to leave an institution, like the tertiary broker, it's pretty easy to do so because I have already started and keep track of my relationship and feelings about the other institutions.

When it comes to liquid cash (bank accounts), I use a [fund accounting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fund_accounting) strategy inspired primarily by the book [*Profit First*](https://profitfirstbook.com). So, I have multiple sub-accounts, each with a specific purpose.

- Assets
	- Cash and banks
		- Primary credit union
			- Income: A spending account (checking) where all money received from third-parties goes; this starts the flow before money is transferred to other accounts.
			- Expenses: A spending account for paying expenses; usually these expenses are due each month or on shorter time-scales.
			- Investing pass-through: A spending account where money is transferred; this is the only account brokers can deposit and withdrawal to and from, respectively.
			- Runway: A savings account for future, known expenses; usually due within two to 12 months.
			- Savings: A savings account as an extension of the Runway *and* for taking advantage of long-term savings and investing opportunities, when available.
			- Taxes: A savings account where I set aside a certain percentage of each dollar of income incase I owe taxes at the end of the year.
		- Secondary credit union
			- Checking: Not really used, but it allows me to easily transfer money into the account from the Expenses account at the primary credit union.
			- Savings: Not really used, but required to open the account with the credit union.
		- Tertiary bank
			- Checking: Same as the secondary credit union checking account.
		- Digital wallet(s): Apple Cash, PayPal, and similar.
		- Cash on hand: Physical cash in my pockets, cookie jars, and the like.
	- Brokers
		- Primary broker
		- Secondary broker
		- Tertiary broker

Last we'll break down the brokerage accounts. Most of my investments are in index funds and there is a separate entry for each vehicle. By making these accounts, I can keep track of my cost basis; how much money I've put into each. I do not adjust for the daily valuation of the account. The transactions on these broker accounts for bookkeeping purposes are limited to purchases, exchanges, dividends, and realized capital gains and losses.

- Assets
	- Cash and banks
		- Primary credit union
			- Income
			- Expenses
			- Investing pass-through
			- Runway
			- Savings
			- Taxes
		- Secondary credit union
			- Checking
			- Savings
		- Tertiary bank
			- Checking
		- Digital wallet(s)
		- Cash on hand
	- Brokers
		- Primary broker
			- Taxable - settlement fund: Used to transfer money to and from the Investing pass-through account before buying more shares in the index fund(s) within the account.
			- Taxable - investment(s): Mostly index funds. There is a separate entry for each holding.
			- Traditional [.Individual Retirement Account](IRA) - settlement fund: Same as Taxable - settlement fund.
			- Traditional IRA - investment(s): Same as Taxable - investment(s).
			- Roth IRA - settlement fund: Same as Taxable - settlement fund.
			- Roth IRA - investment(s): Same as Taxable - investment(s).
		- Secondary broker
			- Taxable - settlement fund: Same as Primary broker.
			- Taxable - investment(s): Same as Primary broker.
			- 401k - investment(s): There is no settlement account here and there are separate entries for each investment inside the 401k. For bookkeeping purposes I separate my contributions from the employer match.
			- [.Health Savings Account](HSA) - cash account: Same as the various settlement funds. However, since this is an HSA where I can spend cash on doctors and whatnot, this also acts like a spending account. For my purposes though it's mainly a settlement fund.
		- Tertiary broker
			- Taxable - cash account: Same as settlement funds.
			- Taxable - investment(s): Same other investment accounts.

Each broker offers traditional and Roth IRAs and taxable accounts. The broker for my 401k was chosen by my employer; the Traditional IRA is the fallback. The HSA is sort of the odd one out because I'm not using the provider selected by my employer and I don't have a tertiary fallback.

So, without the notes: 

- Assets
	- Cash and banks
		- Primary credit union
			- Income
			- Expenses
			- Investing pass-through
			- Runway
			- Savings
			- Taxes
		- Secondary credit union
			- Checking
			- Savings
		- Tertiary bank
			- Checking
		- Digital wallet(s)
		- Cash on hand
	- Brokers
		- Primary broker
			- Taxable - settlement fund
			- Taxable - investment(s)
			- Traditional [.Individual Retirement Account](IRA) - settlement fund
			- Traditional IRA - investment(s)
			- Roth IRA - settlement fund
			- Roth IRA - investment(s)
		- Secondary broker
			- Taxable - settlement fund
			- Taxable - investment(s)
			- 401k - investment(s)
			- [.Health Savings Account](HSA) - cash account
		- Tertiary broker
			- Taxable - cash account
			- Taxable - investment(s)

You might be thinking this is complicated. And I would say with the apps that are available and how the accounts are actually, it doesn't feel that way; especially with the use of Wave, which I have syncing with the income and credit card accounts, which we'll get to later.

Most of the brokerage accounts, at this point, just receive money. So, I only mess around with them when I'm reconciling or rebalancing them.

The accounts at the secondary and tertiary institutions aren't really used.

That leaves the primary credit union. My paycheck goes into the income account. I use Wave and a spreadsheet to create a plan; usually takes about 15 minutes to create the plan and entries; the prepare part of the action loop. Then I spend another 45 minutes or so verifying transactions since the previous paycheck, transferring money, and making credit card payments.

Typically I'm only investing in one or two investments per paycheck, so, minimal activity there as well. 

## Liabilities

- Liabilities
	- Revolving loans (credit cards, lines of credit, and so on)
		- Primary credit union
			- Quaternary credit card: A low rate card with no rewards or similar program.
			- Line of credit: Used for overdraft protection on the checking account.
		- Secondary credit union
			- Primary credit card: A rewards card that has three percent cash back on the types of establishments I used most.
		- Tertiary bank
			- Secondary credit card: A rewards card that has one-point-five percent cash back on all purchases, which is what I use for items that don't have better rewards with the other cards.
		- Apple
			- Tertiary credit card: A rewards card that offers three percent cash back on Apple products and two percent cash back at places that accept Apply Pay.

I don't have any terminal loans anymore and I pay the cards off each month. Each card syncs automatically with Wave; except the Apple Card because it's not available like that yet. However, outside of subscriptions with Apple and apps it doesn't get used much. Updating the transactions for the Apple Card are part of the transaction refinement described in the Assets section.

## Distributions

I post to the [paycheck-by-paycheck](/finances/building-wealth-paycheck-to-paycheck/) area every first and fifteenth. However, I get paid every two weeks as of this writing; so, I distribute money about every two weeks.

Money comes into the income account.

I update the balance trackers in my spreadsheet. 

Mainly I’m trying to get the balances of my credit cards. The credit card balances plus any bills I can’t pay by credit card sets the minimum distribution to the expense account.

I have estimated amounts for my recurring expenses that creates a minimum and maximum for what goes into the runway account. Sometimes I’ll transfer money from this account to the expense account.

Then I have percents set that establishes the minimum and maximum dollar amounts for the other accounts. This is where most of the decisions and possibly wiggling occurs.

Once I have that figured out I head over to Wave.

I’ll look at each account to make sure the transactions are valid and verified. I’ll also create any missing entries. If there’s a mistake or something like that I’ll make note of which institution or institutions I need to call and I won’t proceed until I can make the calls.

Otherwise, I’ll create the entries for the transfers from the income account to the other accounts. Then I’ll add entries to pay the credit cards. Finally I’ll create entries for investments.

Doing this in Wave before actually doing it in the apps (or websites) for the institutions I can verify the outcome of the plan. I want to make sure the expense account will end up with the desired reserve amount, or close to it, after all the money finishes moving.

Finally I’ll hop through the apps (or websites) for the institutions and actually set the transactions in motion.

## Transferring from the Tax account

After filing taxes, if I owe taxes, I’ll transfer money from the tax account to the expense account and pay the taxes; further, the percent from income distributions going to the tax account will be increased by 1. 

If I qualify for a refund, it must be received prior to the next bit. (When the refund is received, it will be treated as income and distributed accordingly.)

Next is determining how much to transfer to the savings account.

- x: Balance of the tax account as of January first of the tax year.
- y: Total deposits to the tax account during the tax year.
- z: Total transferred to expense account to pay owed taxes.
- a: Pool available to transfer to savings account

```x + y - z = a```

I can transfer up to 80 percent of the pool to the savings account. This move puts money back into circulation within the system; see next section.

If money is owed, and there isn't enough in the Tax account to cover the amount, cash should be withdrawn from the accounts in the following order:

1. savings,
2. runway.

If more money is needed, something has gone horribly wrong and you should be consulting with accountants and attorneys.

## Spending savings

Money in the savings account is different than an emergency fund in that it’s there to take advantage of opportunities instead of crisis.

The following events open the possibility of spending cash reserves (or not setting aside a percentage):

<details>
<summary>Too much cash</summary>

Barring extenuating circumstances (like owing thousands of dollars), if the balance of cash reserves causes the cash portion of the portfolio to be higher than the maximum established, cash may be immediately spent to buy a single security in the portfolio.

</details>

<details>
<summary>90 day cool down</summary>

If it’s been 90 days since the last spend from cash reserves, up to 50 percent of the cash reserves balance can be used to buy a single security in the portfolio.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Buying a dip</summary>

If the current price of a security is 3–30 percent less than the 52 week high for that security, cash reserves may be used to purchase that security.

The percent of cash reserves that may be used is equal to the percent the security is down.

For example, if the security is down 5 percent, you may use up to 5 percent of the cash reserves to purchase the single security.

</details>

Constraints on how cash reserves may be spent:

1. Each spend can only be used to purchase one security.
2. Purchasing the security cannot put the portfolio out of balance.
3. There must be at least 7 days between spends, regardless of event timings.
4. If the current price of a security is down more than 30 percent of the 52 week high, cash reserves cannot be used to purchase that security.
