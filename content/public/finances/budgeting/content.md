# Budgeting

{!!dateblock!!}

I've always been torn on the word "budget." Mainly because I think the connotation of the word has overtaken the denotation (common use) of the word, which is:

> an estimate of income and expenditure for a set period of time.

That's not bad, right?

Unfortunately, many think of budgeting in terms of another word whose connotation has given it a bad rap; "diet," which has two common usages (we're talking about the second when we talk in terms of a negative reputation):

> 1. the kinds of food that a person, animal, or community habitually eats
> 2. a special course of food to which one restricts oneself, either to lose weight or for medical reasons

Budget means restricting the spending, not estimating income and expenses in a given period. I don't do restriction well. Hell, I barely do delayed gratification well.

Now, budget as a verb means to allow a certain amount of money to be allocated toward something in a budget (noun).

Just like you have a diet (the food you habitually eat), you have a budget. The question here is how intentional is that budget (diet)? How mindful are you of that budget (diet)?

The following describes my current method.

## Traditional bank accounts

I consolidated down from my previous method (that ran from around 2005 to 2021). I'm still rocking the same credit union I've had since around 1992. I'm essentially doing [fund accounting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fund_accounting) and the method described in Profit First.

There are six sub-accounts:

- Income: A spending account (checking) where all money received from third-parties goes; this starts the flow before money is transferred to the other accounts.
- Profit: A savings account where a certain percentage of the money coming in goes; this is for emergencies and extended runway.
- Taxes: A savings account where a certain percentage of the money coming in goes; this is to prepare for possibly owing taxes each year.
- Operating Expenses: A spending account where a percentage of money goes; this is for paying bills.
- Runway: A savings account where a percentage of money goes; this is used to prepare for future expenses and emergencies.
- Investing Pass-through: A spending account where a percentage of money goes; this is used by brokerage accounts.

Money deposited to the Income account is moved to the other accounts on the date the money is received to ensure the average daily balance of the other accounts (specifically the various savings accounts) is as high as possible for as long as possible; interest is based on the average daily balance.

The Operating Expenses and Investing Pass-through accounts don't earn dividends, therefore, the balance will typically be held relatively close to a zero balance.

## Categories

Categories in accounting software can quickly turn into the problem I’ve seen categories and tagging in the blogosphere and project management tools; every transaction needing its own category. This approach can quickly lead to overwhelm as, across the entire income and expenses ledger, each purchase garners only a few percentage points. This hides useful metrics.

With this in mind, I prefer additive systems over subtractive systems.

With an additive system you start with bare bones constraints and setup; then add what you need when you need to. With subtractive systems you are given everything and the kitchen sink up front, just in case you need it later.

In my [coaching practice](/coaching/) I've realized that the kitchen sink approach can often lead to an invisible hand driving people to find ways to use capabilities of the system even if they don't need them:

> Why are we doing X? Because we can.

Anyhoo.

I want to have a minimal set of categories. This makes it easier for me to remember which categories exist and tends to give me enough information to visualize income and expenses quickly. 

Instead of `Phone - landline` and `Phone - mobile`, I have `Electronics`. The bills for purchasing electronic equipment (like a cellphone) fall under this category. The bills for services that make these tools function (service and internet, for example), also fall under this category. One category covering a lot ground and making it easier to see the impact of all my electronics, regardless of a particular service needed to make it function the way it was intended.

Unfortunately, for me at least, most accounting software come with a bunch of categories, just in case you need it. Enter the workaround; prefix the categories you use with a special character—I use the hyphen (-).

So, if I see a category of `Fuel`, I know I don't use that category, because it doesn't start with a hyphen. And, I may never use it even if I had a car; refueling might go under `- Transportation`, along with the car payments. If I wanted to track fuel, I might rename the provided `Fuel` to `- Transportation - fuel`, for example. 

Prefixing with a special character is also something of a computer hack. When software is used to sort a list of items symbols tend to come before numbers, which come before letters.

So, when the dropdown is expanded in my accounting app, the categories that start with the hyphen are at the top of the list:

```
- Food
Apples
Fuel
```

This means I can quickly scan down through the list of categories I actually use before scanning the unused or no longer being used categories (more on this in a moment).

When I first set up the accounting app, I created a `Miscellaneous expenses` category and a `Miscellaneous revenue` category (I won't use the hyphenated versions for the purposes of these inline examples). Then I went through and reconciled a single month. With each transaction I asked myself if this was something I want to track specifically; that's where the `Food` category came from. As I continued reconciling though, I decided I want to track dining out separately, which is where the `Food - dining` category came from.

As of this writing I still smoke tobacco and walk to convenience stores every couple of days to get a pack of cigarettes and snacks. I could categorize this as `Food` because of the snacks, but both are actually luxuries that could be cut from my life, if needed. So, I created a `Habits - tobacco` category and another for `Food - snacks`. The `Habits - tobacco` category lets me track spending specific to that habit. 

For things I don't buy very often, like clothes, I can just use the `Miscellaneous expenses` category. For things I spend regularly on, I can create a different category. 

For example, I pay rent regularly, it gets flagged as `Housing`. This is also where other bills related to the apartment go; like electricity, water, internet, and so on. If I want to track something specifically, I can create a different category. When I no longer feel like tracking that specific item, I can stop using the category and maybe put those transactions under a different, higher-level category.

For example, in early 2021 thanks to the `Food - dining` category I learned I spent thousands of dollars dining out; this was way more than my tobacco habit, in fact. For someone who's not into food it was excessive. So, in 2022, I decided to adjust both `Food - dining` and `Food - snacks`. If both of those categories become small enough, I'll stop using the categories, but won’t delete or archive them.

## Distributions



## Spending cash reserves 

Cash reserves are different than an emergency fund in that cash reserves are there for times of opportunity while emergency funds are there for times of strife.

A portion of each paycheck is set aside for cash reserves. The following events open the possibility of spending cash reserves:

<details>
<summary>Too much cash</summary>

Barring extenuating circumstances (like possibly owing thousands of dollars), if the balance of cash reserves causes the cash portion of the portfolio to be higher than the maximum set, cash may be immediately spent to buy a single security in the portfolio.

</details>

<details>
<summary>90 day cool down</summary>

If it’s been 90 days since the last spend from cash reserves, up to 50 percent of the cash reserves balance can be used to buy a single security in the portfolio.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Buying the dip</summary>

If the current price of a security is 3–30 percent less than the average of the 52 week high and low, cash reserves may be used to purchase that security.

The percent of cash reserves that may be used is equal to the percent the security is down.

For example, if the security is down 5 percent, you may use up to 5 percent of the cash reserves to purchase the single security.

<details>

Constraints on how cash reserves may be spent:

1. Each spend can only be used to purchase one security.
2. Purchasing the security cannot put the portfolio out of balance.
3. There must be at least 7 days between spends, regardless of event timings.
4. If the current price of a security is 30 percent or more less than the average of the 52 week high and low, cash reserves cannot be used to purchase that security.
