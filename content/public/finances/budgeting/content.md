# Budgeting

{!!dateblock!!}

I've always been torn on the word "budget." Mainly because I think the connotation of the word has overtaken the denotation (common use) of the word, which is:

> an estimate of income and expenditure for a set period of time.

That's not bad or scary, right?

Unfortunately, many think of budgeting in terms of another word whose connotation has given it a bad rap; "diet," which has two common uses:

> 1. the kinds of food that a person, animal, or community habitually eats
> 2. a special course of food to which one restricts oneself, either to lose weight or for medical reasons

When we talk about the bad rap of the word budget, we’re talking about that second usage. In other words, budget means restricting spending, not estimating income and expenses in a given period. 

I don't do restriction well. Hell, I barely do delayed gratification well.

Budget can be both a verb and a noun. Budget as a verb means to allow a certain amount of money to be allocated toward something in a budget (noun).

Just like you have a diet (the food you habitually eat), you have a budget. The question here is how intentional and transparent is that budget (diet)? How mindful are you of that budget (diet)?

The following describes my current method.

## Traditional bank accounts

I simplified from my previous method (that ran from around 2005 to 2021). I'm still rocking the credit union I've had since 1992. I'm essentially doing [fund accounting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fund_accounting) inspired by the method described in *Profit First*.

There are six sub-accounts:

- Income: A spending account (checking) where all money received from third-parties goes; this starts the flow before money is transferred to other accounts.
- Cash Reserves: A savings account where a certain percentage of the money coming in goes; this is for extended runway, taking advantage of opportunities, and emergencies.
- Taxes: A savings account where a certain percentage of the money coming in goes; this is to prepare for possibly owing taxes each year.
- Operating Expenses: A spending account where a percentage of money goes; this is for paying bills.
- Runway: A savings account where a percentage of money goes; this is to prepare for known future expenses and emergencies.
- Investing Pass-through: A spending account where a percentage of money goes; this is used by brokerage accounts.

Money deposited to the Income account is moved to the other accounts on the date the money is received to ensure the average daily balance of the other accounts (specifically the savings accounts) is as high as possible for as long as possible; interest earned is based on the average daily balance.

The Operating Expenses and Investing Pass-through accounts don't earn dividends, therefore, the balance will typically be held relatively close zero.

## Categories

Categories in accounting software can quickly turn problematic as it can feel like every transaction needs a unique category. This approach can quickly lead to overwhelm as, across the entire income and expenses ledger, each purchase garners only a few percentage points hiding more useful metrics.

For example, Streaming Service A is only 1 percent of expenses, that’s okay, yeah? But putting all streaming services in the same category shows they are 50 percent of expenses.

With this in mind, I prefer additive systems over subtractive systems.

Additive systems start with bare bones constraints and setup; then you add what you need when you need it. With subtractive systems you're given everything and the kitchen sink up front, just in case you need it later.

In my [coaching practice](/coaching/) I've realized that the kitchen sink approach can lead to an invisible hand driving people to find ways to use capabilities of the system even if they don't need them:

> Why are we doing X? Because we can.

Anyhoo.

I want a minimal set of categories. This makes it easier for me to remember which categories exist and tends to give me enough information to quickly visualize income and expenses.

Instead of `Phone - landline` and `Phone - mobile`, I have `Electronics`. The bills for purchasing electronic equipment (like a cellphone) fall under this category. The bills for services that make these tools function (service and internet, for example), fall under this category. One category covering a lot of ground and making it easier to see the impact of all my electronics, regardless of a particular service needed to make it function the way it was intended.

Unfortunately, for me at least, most accounting software comes with a bunch of categories, just in case you need it. Enter the workaround; prefix the categories you use with a special character—I use the hyphen (-).

So, if I see a category of `Fuel`, I know I don't use that category, because it doesn't start with a hyphen. If I owned a car, I probably still wouldn’t use the `Fuel` category. Instead I’d probably create a `- Transportation` category where car payments, insurance, bus fare, tax payments, parking fees, and so on would go. 

This approach lets me see [total cost of ownership](/finances/total-cost-of-ownership/) more easily.

If I wanted to track fuel specifically for a little while, I might rename the original `Fuel` category to `- Transportation - Fuel`.

Prefixing with a special character is something of a computer hack. 

When software is used to sort a list of items symbols tend to come before numbers, which come before letters. So, when the dropdown is expanded in my accounting app, the categories starting with the hyphen are at the top of the list:

```
- Food
Apples
Fuel
```

This means I can quickly scan down through the list of categories I use before scanning the unused or no longer used categories (more on this in a moment).

When I first set up the accounting app, I created a `Miscellaneous expenses` category and a `Miscellaneous revenue` category (I won't use the hyphenated versions for the purposes of these inline examples). Then I went through and reconciled a single month. With each transaction I asked myself if this was something I want to track specifically; that's where the `Food` category came from. As I continued reconciling though, I decided I want to track dining out separately, which is where the `Food - dining` category came from.

As of this writing I smoke tobacco and walk to convenience stores every couple of days to get a pack of cigarettes and possibly snacks. I could categorize this as `Food` because of the snacks, but both are actually conveniences that could be cut from my life, if needed. So, I created a `Habits - tobacco` category and another for `Food - snacks`. The `Habits - tobacco` category lets me track spending specific to that habit.

For things I don't buy often, like clothes, I can use the `Miscellaneous expenses` category. For things I spend regularly on, I can create a different category.

## Distributions

Every paycheck, or every two weeks, I redistribute money; I only post here on the first and fifteenth though.

### Establishing the baseline

I don't remember the resource or resources I pulled this idea from; believe it was an episode of the [Choose FI podcast](https://www.choosefi.com/listen/choose-fi-podcast/). It goes like this, there are three types of expenses:

1. basic,
2. utility, and
3. convenience.

Basic expenses are those things that are required and tend to be fixed; keeping the lights on expenses. For example, you might consider house payments or rent to be basic.

It’s worth noting that required here is as much psychological as it may be literal. “If I want to keep X in my life, I need to spend Y” as opposed to, “I need to spend Y to survive.” Living in my car for a year quickly taught me the difference.

Utility are required expenses, however, may be less required than what you consider basic. Further, you have some control over how much you spend without changing providers or the item itself. For example, electricity, food, and taxes.

Convenience are expenses that add to your life and could be cut entirely or reduced dramatically. For example, insurance on electronics and some subscription services.

Capture all of these expenses along with:

1. how much the expense will be (even if an estimate),
2. how many paychecks will be received between payments, and
3. which type of expense it is.

Do this for each known future expense.

I have a cellphone I believe needs to be replaced every 4 or 5 years. The phone will be around 800 [.United States Dollars](USD), I will receive roughly 120 paychecks between replacements, and it's a basic expense. It's a basic expense because I consider communication to be a requirement and while I have flexibility in the phone I purchase, I plan on purchasing the same or similar phone as the one I have. The affordance of being able to make and receive phone calls is the requirement.

Coupled to the cellphone, I have a service plan. The amount is roughly 35 USD per month, I’ll receive at least 2 paychecks between statements, and it's a basic expense because for the phone to serve its required purpose it must have service.

I need food to survive. I spend anywhere from 50 to 70 USD per week on food, I'll receive 0.5 paychecks between replenishments, and I consider it a utility expense. I consider food to be a utility expense because within some range, I have the ability to control how much I spend per week on food; coupons, sales, member card discounts, just eating less, and so on.

In 2021 I spent 1,750 USD on tobacco products for the year, I’ll receive roughly 26 paychecks in a year, and I consider tobacco products to be a convenience expense. 

Once you've got enough these known future expenses in place to have seated the habit of capturing them, determine how much per paycheck you'll set aside for each expense and where you'll put it.

If I'm planning to need the money in one year or less, I'll typically put it in the Runway account. Any longer than a year, it typically goes into an investment account of some sort.

The goal here is to know, roughly, what your minimum living expenses could be and establish a priority should things go pear-shaped. 

For example, at present I have a laptop and a desktop computer. I set aside a certain amount per paycheck to replace both. I consider the laptop to be a utility expense while the desktop is a convenience. If things go sideways and it comes time to replace one, the other, or both, chances are I'd only replace the laptop. All of the money set aside for the smooth operation of my electronic hardware is placed in a conservative investment account because I plan on keeping each device for roughly 5 years.

### Preparing for known future expenses

With the aforementioned in place and money squirreled away to cover those known expenses, I'm ready to figure out distributions using [Wave](https://www.waveapps.com) to create a plan.

Every paycheck, I sum the total balance of each credit card I have and each bill that’s due. I make sure the Operating Expenses account will be left at around 100 USD after paying each credit card and bill. Sometimes this requires moving money from the Runway account; usually when paying rent or purchasing the item I had been preparing for.

I sum all the partial payments for known future expenses due within the next 12 months and put that in the Runway account.

I sum all known future expenses due after 12 months or more and put those into the conservative securities I have for each.

That covers short-term needs.

### Preparing for unknown future expenses

Making sure I can keep the lights on out of the way, time to move on to preparing for the known unknowns. (This could be called preparing for retirement.)

My employer is responsible for paying the majority of my taxes, however, I generate extra income from various sources including dividends on savings and investments. Therefore, I make sure I'm putting a bit aside to cover the possibility of owing taxes. As of this writing, I have 2 percent of each check going to the Tax account.

I distribute at least 100 USD up to the maximum cash percentage set by the asset allocation of the portfolio to Cash Reserves account.

Whatever remains goes toward the taxable brokerage account and Roth Individual Retirement Account.

## Transferring from the Tax account

The maximum transfer is 80 percent of the available balance. Transfers are made to the Cash Reserves account. The following criteria must be met:

1. taxes for the year were filed and accepted by the Government; and
2. if money is owed, it was paid out of the Tax account and received by the Government; or
3. if a refund is expected, it was received and deposited to the Income account and transferred to the Tax account.

This move puts money back into circulation within the system; see next section.

If money is owed, the amount sent to the Tax account must be increased by at least 1 percent. 

If money is owed, and there isn't enough in the Tax account to cover the amount, cash should be withdrawn from the accounts in the following order:

1. Cash Reserves,
2. Runway.

If more money is needed, something has gone horribly wrong and you should be consulting with accountants and attorneys.

## Spending cash reserves

Cash reserves are different than an emergency fund in that cash reserves are there for times of opportunity while emergency funds are there for times of strife.

A portion of each paycheck is set aside for cash reserves; not to exceed the maximum cash reserve percent and it cannot cause the proportion of cash in the portfolio to go over the maximum cash allowed. 

The following events open the possibility of spending cash reserves (or not setting aside a percentage):

<details>
<summary>Too much cash</summary>

Barring extenuating circumstances (like owing thousands of dollars), if the balance of cash reserves causes the cash portion of the portfolio to be higher than the maximum established, cash may be immediately spent to buy a single security in the portfolio.

</details>

<details>
<summary>90 day cool down</summary>

If it’s been 90 days since the last spend from cash reserves, up to 50 percent of the cash reserves balance can be used to buy a single security in the portfolio.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Buying a dip</summary>

If the current price of a security is 3–30 percent less than the 52 week high for that security, cash reserves may be used to purchase that security.

The percent of cash reserves that may be used is equal to the percent the security is down.

For example, if the security is down 5 percent, you may use up to 5 percent of the cash reserves to purchase the single security.

</details>

Constraints on how cash reserves may be spent:

1. Each spend can only be used to purchase one security.
2. Purchasing the security cannot put the portfolio out of balance.
3. There must be at least 7 days between spends, regardless of event timings.
4. If the current price of a security is down more than 30 of the 52 week high, cash reserves cannot be used to purchase that security.
