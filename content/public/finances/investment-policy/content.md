# Investment Policy

{!!dateblock!!}

An investment policy is entered between a financial advisor and yourself. In my case, I am the financial advisor and think it is beneficial to enter an agreement with myself when I am at peace. I want to do it while I'm at peace and in a good place because when things go pear-shaped I can come back to the mechanical side of things.

I started with the outline developed by [The White Coat Investor](https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/how-to-write-an-investing-personal-statement/) and here is my investment policy.

## Financial goals

In keeping with the [meet in the middle](/finances/) practice, I want to reverse engineer from the least acceptable to most acceptable retirement ages that are both most likely for reaching [.financial independence](FI).

This gives me what I refer to as a Coast FI stack; multiple coast FI numbers and achievement ages. Further, each coast FI number as a lower retirement age:

- Coast FI 1: $155,034
	1. Starting at age: 41
	2. Achieved by age: 43
	3. Retire by age: 67
	4. Starting balance of: $47,000
- Coast FI 2: $170,925
	1. Starting at: 43
	2. Achieved by: 44
	3. Retire by: 65
	4. Starting balance of: $155,034
- Coast FI 3: $220,056
	1. Starting at: 44
	2. Achieved by: 46
	3. Retire by: 60
	4. Starting balance of: $170,925
- Coast FI 4: $322,304
	1. Starting at: 46
	2. Achieved by: 48
	3. Retire by: 55
	4. Starting balance of: $229,056
- Coast FI 5: $453,515
	1. Starting at: 48
	2. Achieved by: 50
	3. Retire by: 50<sup>*</sup>
	4. Starting balance of: $322,304
- FIRE: $500,000

<summary>Details</summary>

A coast FI number is calculated using multiple variables:

1. FIRE number,
2. net worth,
2. rate of return,
3. savings rate, 
4. withdraw rate,
5. target retirement age, 
6. current age, and
6. optional projected inflation rate.

I used the [Coast FI calculator from Wallet Burst](https://walletburst.com/tools/coast-fire-calc/) (I can’t speak to the quality of content on the rest of the site, but I appreciated the calculator).

1. I set the FIRE number to 500,000 USD; total cost of lifestyle of 25,000 USD times 25.
2. My net worth at age 41 was just under 50,000.
3. I used 8 percent for the rate of return, which some might view as too high or too low.
4. I seem to be able save around 4,000 USD per month.
5. I used the 4 percent rule of thumb as the withdraw rate.
6. I started with 67 years old as the latest acceptable retirement age.
7. I started with 41, which was my age at the time.
8. And I used 3 percent for inflation, which is the average for the last 100 years, is higher than the period between 2010 and 2021, and is lower than the beginning of 2022 (averages are funny that way).

Using these initial variables, gave me the first set of results.

From there I was able increase the current age and net worth using the achievement age and coast FI number from the first set. Before running the calculation again, I reduced the target retirement age. Running the calculation gave me a new set, which I used to create the next set; adjusting the same 3 variables.

There's my primary retirement goal; able to “retire” by 50. By breaking it down I’m setting micro-goals that aren’t a decade away. Let me see if I can get the 155,000 USD by age 43. If I do that, let me see if I can get the 170,000 USD. And so on. 

Even if I’m not able to retire by 50, if I hit that first target, I should at least be in good shape to retire around the average age.

## Investments

Italics indicate items taken directly (or paraphrased) from the White Coat Investor.

- *I will strive to minimize the effects of taxes and expenses on our investment returns.*
- *My primary investment vehicles will be broad-based index funds, preferably in tax-advantaged accounts.*
- *I will buy, hold, and not panic during market corrections; unless I lose all faith in American businesses, governments, and money.*
- My savings rate and returns will be determined on a per-paycheck basis as a natural result of the [Building Wealth Paycheck to Paycheck](/finances/building-wealth-paycheck-to-paycheck/) workflow.
- I’ll do what I can to vote with my dollars on the individual level and spread the level evenly in my personal investments.
- I’ll contribute at least $100 per paycheck to long-term savings.
- I’ll use a modified [total stock market and chill](https://www.liveoffdividends.com/financial-independence-order-of-operations/) strategy.
- Retirement withdrawal rate will be 3.5 percent. If portfolio increases 50 percent over 3 years, increase annual withdrawal by 10 percent (not the withdrawal rate). ex. Year 1 withdraw twenty thousand [.United States dollars](USD); year 2 withdraw 20,000 USD; year 3 withdraw 20,000 USD; year 4, if portfolio value is 50 percent more than year 1, withdraw 22,000 USD. Presuming next 4 years do the same, withdraw 24,200 USD. (Modifications are possible depending on [age and health](https://www.choosefi.com/flexible-spending-rules-for-early-retirees/)).
	- Revisit
- For the equities portion of my portfolio, I’ll strive to be evenly distributed between small-, mid-, and large-cap stocks.

Note: Each bullet is aligned to my financial [values, principles, and practices](/finances/).

## Asset allocation

Investments will be in four tax buckets:

- Taxable
  - post-tax going in,
	- taxed on dividends (either as ordinary income or capital gains depending on the type of investment), and
	- taxed on capital gains upon withdrawal (realized).
- Tax-deferred (traditional IRA and 401k, for example):
	- potentially pre-tax going in,
	- tax-exempt while growing, and
	- taxed on withdrawal.
- Tax-free (Roth):
	- post-tax going in,
	- tax-exempt while growing, and
	- tax-exempt on withdrawal.
- Triple-tax advantaged
  - pre-tax (or tax-deductible) going in,
  - tax-exempt while growing, and
  - potentially tax-exempt on withdrawal.

For the taxable account there are potential tax advantages for selling a position with capital losses; referred to as [tax-loss harvesting](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxgainlossharvesting.asp). I don't plan on doing anything intentionally with tax-loss harvesting unless or until I understand it.

I have multiple groups for macro-asset classes from debt to large-cap [.United States](US) equities. I do include debt despite debt being a liability in accounting terminology. Each macro-asset class is given a range of percentages (similar to [Bollinger Bands](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/technical-analysis/technical-indicator-guide/bollinger-bands)) representing the proportion the value of each asset class should be each [paycheck or payout](/finances/building-wealth-paycheck-to-paycheck/).

Cash is a portion of the portfolio, however, while in [accumulation mode](/finances/concepts/#accumulation-drawdown-and-rebalancing), the objective will be to keep cash at a minimum and view it as the reserve portion of the portfolio. From a long-term perspective, I'm hoping to build the cash reserve to be one year's worth of expenses by the time I step away from traditional employment.

### Coast FI 1 (43 years old)

Once I reach Coast FI 1, I plan to begin moving toward a risk parity style portfolio by adding long-term treasuries and a little gold to the mix. If I leave my current employer, I may decide to roll the 401k there to my new employer, or, push it into a Traditional [.Individual Retirement Account](IRA). 

### Coast FI 2 (44 years old)

Coast FI 2 would see me increase diversification with an increase in long-term treasuries and gold and the addition of commodities.

### Coast FI 3 (46 years old)

Increase bond, gold, and commodities exposure. 

### Coast FI 4 (48 years old)

Decrease US equities exposure while increasing exposure to other asset classes.

### FIRE-able (50 years old)

Decrease US equities exposure while increasing exposure to the other asset classes in proportion.

At this point, the taxable account should be able to support my modest lifestyle for 10 years.

At age 60 I'll be able to lean on the tax-deferred accounts, which should have balances high enough to cover me for another 10 years. From the age of 60 to 70 should give a chance for the taxable account to cool off.

I plan on reserving the tax-free accounts until age 70. If there are funds still available in the tax-deferred buckets, I’ll continuing leaning more on those, however. The rationale being that when I reach age 72, I’ll be required to take minimum distributions from the tax-deferred accounts.

I plan on having some form of earned income until my passing. This will be through books, art, and the like, which I'll create on my own schedule and not because I necessarily need to in order to survive.

### Beyond FIRE

No idea.

The fact my Agile-brain has even allowed me to come up with a 10 year "plan" is crazy-talk. One of the Agile values is adapting to change over following a plan, so, I’ll adjust as time progresses. In other words, this is a plan like any other, once met with reality it may become moot.

What makes me feel comfortable about it is it's based on the value of the portfolio, which is the crux of the whole thing. So, if time slips a bit, I still have the same goal and, once I hit Coast FI 1, the retirement date is acceptable, though not ideal.

Asset allocation is the proportion of each asset class compared to the value of the overall portfolio. Tax location is related to the tax treatment of funds flowing in and out of the portfolio. Diversification is about choosing asset classes that have [low correlation](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/asset-correlations) to each other.

In the beginning I aim to keep over 90 percent of the value in US equities. Over the course of accumulation mode this allocation will shift to a more diversified, risk parity portfolio.

## Emergency fund (cash and credit)

As counterintuitive as it may sound, the majority of my emergency fund will reside in revolving loans. These loans have relatively low interest rates and I'm taking a somewhat hard stance on what constitutes an emergency; a trip a few months from now is not an emergency and I should try and save what I can before the trip to pay for it.

I also have a broad definition of cash when it comes to this emergency fund. Money already in risk parity style holdings may be considered cash should an emergency arise. (For the purposes of tracking, these earmarked funds aren’t considered cash, however.) These minor holdings should have the lowest risk and volatility while achieving a higher rate of return compared to liquid cash. As such, while in accumulation mode, only 3 to 6 months will be in liquid cash, which would shift to roughly 12 months in drawdown mode.

These long-term savings accounts, if you will, will also be used to save for and replace things like cellphone, laptop, and so on. These tools will only be replaced if the current version no longer serves its intended purpose in my life; just because the time is right, I have the means, and there's a new model, doesn't mean I should buy it right then. 

## Housing and paying off debt

- Monthly housing expenses will be less than 30% of my net income.
- I’ll not seek to own my own home unless it’s part of an assisted living strategy, generates rental income, or both.
- Debt will be avoided when possible and paid off immediately, while maintaining at least a 10 percent contribution per paycheck to savings and investments.

## Cash reserves, dollar cost averaging, and out of cycle purchasing

Cash reserves and emergency funds aren’t, strictly speaking, the same thing. Emergency funds are for when things go wrong. Cash reserves are for taking advantage of opportunities related to long-term saving.

The foundation of my investing uses dollar cost averaging on a per paycheck (or per deposit) basis.

A portion of each paycheck is held in reserve; up to the upper cash limit of the portfolio (ex. 10 percent per paycheck, if the max cash band is 10 percent).

See [budgeting for details](/finances/budgeting/)

## Spend and giving

- I'll use the [Building Wealth Paycheck to Paycheck](/finances/building-wealth-paycheck-to-paycheck/) method to help automate these decisions and habits.
- This method will be used every time income is received.
- Contributions will be done in a way that helps maintain desired asset allocations and tax location.

## Changes

- This policy will be revisited regularly.
- Will be changed based on the financial goal being pursued first.
