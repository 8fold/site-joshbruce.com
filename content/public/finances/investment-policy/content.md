# Investment Policy

{!!dateblock!!}

An investment policy is entered between a financial advisor and yourself. In my case, I am the financial advisor and think it is beneficial to enter an agreement with myself when I am at peace. I want to do it while I'm at peace and in a good place because when things go pear-shaped I can come back to the mechanical side of things.

I started with the outline developed by [The White Coat Investor](https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/how-to-write-an-investing-personal-statement/) and here is my investment policy.

## Financial goals

In keeping with the [meet in the middle](/finances/) practice, I want to reverse engineer from the least acceptable to most acceptable retirement ages that are both most likely for reaching [.financial independence](FI).

This gives me what I refer to as a Coast FI stack. Five Coast FI numbers with decreasing retirement ages, up until the point that the age I should be able to achieve the number corresponds (roughly) with the retirement:

- Coast FI 1: $155,034
	1. Starting at age: 41
	2. Achieved by age: 43
	3. Retire by age: 67
	4. Starting balance of: $47,000
- Coast FI 2: $170,925
	1. Starting at: 43
	2. Achieved by: 44
	3. Retire by: 65
	4. Starting balance of: $155,034
- Coast FI 3: $220,056
	1. Starting at: 44
	2. Achieved by: 46
	3. Retire by: 60
	4. Starting balance of: $170,925
- Coast FI 4: $322,304
	1. Starting at: 46
	2. Achieved by: 48
	3. Retire by: 55
	4. Starting balance of: $229,056
- Coast FI 5: $453,515
	1. Starting at: 48
	2. Achieved by: 50
	3. Retire by: 50<sup>*</sup>
	4. Starting balance of: $322,304
- FIRE: $500,000

<summary>Details</summary>

I created the Coast FI stack using a Coast FI calculator. Coast FI is the amount of money you would need to maintain your current total lifestyle cost at a specified future age or date, without having to save another dollar; the invested amount will grow to within a "safe withdrawal rate" by the specified age.

I used the [Coast FI calculator from Wallet Burst](https://walletburst.com/tools/coast-fire-calc/) (I can’t speak to the quality of content on the rest of the site, but I appreciated the calculator).

I chose a growth rate of **8%**, which might be considered conservative for the market in general. I chose an inflation rate of **3%**, which is the average for the last 100 years and higher than any given year from 2010 to 2021. I used the rule of thumb for a safe withdrawal rate of **4%**, which hypothesizes that you can draw down your net worth by 4% each year and live off those investments alone for around 30 years, at least.

My current total lifestyle cost is roughly $17,760 and I used **$20,000** to give myself a bit of a raise. I still don’t have a normal year’s worth of data to confirm this specific dollar amount. Also, this is total cost of lifestyle, not income. As of August 2021 my expenses were at 19,000 USD, however, 2021 is an outlier year given things I’ve purchased and paid for in full as it were.

I set the monthly contributions to **$4,000**, which is somewhat optimistic and will be adjusted if month-after-month I'm not able to achieve that amount. With that said, these numbers do not include 401(k) contributions made along the way beyond the initial net worth at 41.

This data can be used to generate a static [.financial independence retire early](FIRE) number: `total lifestyle cost * 25`. My FIRE number is $500,000.

Because the numbers account for inflation, they will be in current dollars but may be higher actual balances in the future (1 USD being worth 0.60 cents later means 1 future dollar may be roughly 1.40 USD at that future time).

This gave me the Coast FI number and the age at which I should hit that number. I changed the net worth to be that Coast FI number. I changed the starting age to be the age the calculator estimated I’d hit that number. And I reduced the acceptable retirement age.

For the last row to be achieved, I need to make an extra $2,000 in contributions per month, which should be covered and a bit more by the 401(k) I'm not formally putting in calculations.

There's my primary retirement goal; able to “retire” by 50. By breaking it down I’m setting micro-goals that aren’t a decade away. Let me see if I can get the $155K by age 43. If I do that, let me see if I can get the $170K. And so on. And, if I can make that first one, then I'm in a comfortable position to believe that I will be able to retire at the latest acceptable time for me, which should come with other benefits I'm not counting on (social security, medicare, and the like).

Another thing I appreciate about the table is that it's not bullets and a lot of words. I can scan down the left column for how old I am, scan across and see how close I am to achieving that level of investment, which is not representing my total net worth (traditional savings accounts, real estate, and similar).

## Investments

The items in the following that are taken directly (or paraphrased) from White Coat Investor are indicated in italics.

- *I will strive to minimize the effects of taxes and expenses on our investment returns.*
- *My primary investment vehicles will be broad-based index funds, preferably in tax-advantaged accounts.*
- *I will buy, hold, and not panic during market corrections; unless I lose all faith in American businesses, governments, and money.*
- My savings rate and returns will be determined on a per-paycheck basis as a natural result of the [Building Wealth Paycheck to Paycheck](/finances/building-wealth-paycheck-to-paycheck/) workflow.
- I will do what I can to vote with my dollars on the individual level and spread the level evenly in my personal investments.
- I will contribute at least $100 per paycheck to long-term savings.
- I will use a modified [total stock market and chill](https://www.liveoffdividends.com/financial-independence-order-of-operations/) strategy.
- Retirement withdrawal rate will be 3.5 percent. If portfolio increases by 50 percent over the course of 3 years, increase annual withdrawal by 10 percent (not the withdrawal rate). ex. Year 1 withdrawal twenty thousand [.USD](United States dollars); year 2 withdrawal twenty thousand USD; year 3 withdrawal twenty thousand USD; year 4, if portfolio value is 50 percent more than in year 1, withdrawal twenty-two thousand. Presuming next 4 years do the same, withdrawal twenty-four thousand two hundred USD. (Modifications are possible depending on [age and health](https://www.choosefi.com/flexible-spending-rules-for-early-retirees/)).
- For the equities portion of my portfolios, I will strive to be evenly distributed between small-, mid-, and large-cap stocks.

Notice each of these are aligned with my financial [values, principles, and practices](/finances/).

## Asset allocation

Investments will be in three brokerage accounts (tax buckets):

- Roth IRA:
	- post-tax going in (taxes are paid),
	- tax-exempt while growing, and
	- tax-exempt on withdrawal.
- Tax-deferred (traditional IRA-like):
	- potentially pre-tax going in (I make too much annually to qualify),
	- tax-exempt while growing, and
	- taxed on withdrawal.
- Taxable:
	- post-tax going in,
	- taxed on dividends gained, and
	- taxed on capital gains upon withdrawal (realized).

For the taxable account there are potential tax advantages for selling a position with capital losses; referred to a [tax-loss harvesting](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxgainlossharvesting.asp). I don't plan on doing anything intentionally with tax-loss harvesting unless or until I understand it.

I have multiple groups for macro-asset classes from debt to lard-cap [.United States](US) equities. I do include debt despite debt being a liability in accounting terminology. Each macro-asset class is given a range of percentages (similar to [Bollinger Bands](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/technical-analysis/technical-indicator-guide/bollinger-bands)) representing the proportion the value of each asset class should be each [paycheck or payout](/finances/building-wealth-paycheck-to-paycheck/).

Cash is a portion of the portfolio, however, while in [accumulation mode](/finances/concepts/#accumulation-drawdown-and-rebalancing), the objective will be to keep cash at a minimum and view it as the reserve portion of the portfolio. From a long-term perspective, I'm hoping to build the cash reserve to be one year's worth of expenses by the time I step away from traditional employment.

<details>
<summary>Coast FI 1 (43 years old)</summary>

Once I reach Coast FI 1, I plan to begin moving toward a risk parity style portfolio by adding long-term treasuries and a little gold to the mix. If I leave my current employer, I may decide to roll the 401k there to my new employer, or, push it into a Traditional [.Individual Retirement Account](IRA). 

</details>
<details>
<summary>Coast FI 2 (44 years old)</summary>

Coast FI 2 would see me increase diversification with an increase in long-term treasuries and gold and the addition of US [.Real Estate Investment Trusts](REITs).

</details>
<details>
<summary>Coast FI 3 (46 years old)</summary>

Increase bond and gold exposure. Introduce commodities to the mix.

</details>
<details>
<summary>Coast FI 4 (48 years old)</summary>

Decrease US equities exposure while increasing exposure to other asset classes and add in non-US REITs.

</details>
<details>
<summary>FIRE-able (50 years old)</summary>

Decrease US equities exposure while increasing exposure to the other asset classes in proportion.

At they point, the taxable account should be able to support my modest lifestyle for 10 years.

At age 60 I'll be able to lean on the tax-deferred accounts, which should have balances high enough to cover me for another 10 years. This time will also give me a chance to let the taxable accounts cool down.

I plan on reserving the tax-free accounts until age 70. If there are funds still available in the tax-deferred buckets, I will continuing leaning more on those, however. The rationale being that when I reach age 72, I will be required to take minimum distributions from the tax-deferred accounts.

I plan on having some form of earned income until my passing. This will be through books, art, and the like, which I'll create on my own schedule an not because I necessarily need to in order to survive.

<summary>Beyond FIRE</summary>

No idea.

The fact my Agile-brain has even allowed me to come up with a 10 year "plan" is crazy-talk. One of the Agile values is adapting to change over following a plan, so, I will adjust as time progresses. In other words, this is a plan like any other, once met with reality it may become moot.

What makes me feel comfortable about it is it's based on the value of the portfolio, which is the crux of the whole thing. So, if time slips a bit, I still have the same goal and, once I hit Coast FI 1, the retirement date is acceptable, though not ideal.

<summary>Details</summary>

Asset allocation is the proportion of each asset class compared to the overall portfolio. Tax location is related to the tax treatment of funds flowing in and out of the portfolio. Diversification is about choosing asset classes that have [low correlation](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/asset-correlations) to each other.

In the beginning I aim to keep over 90 percent of the value in US equities. Over the time during accumulation mode this will shift to a more diversified, risk parity portfolio. Regardless of time, I hope to maintain roughly equal distribution across US equities based on market capitalization.

## Emergency fund (cash and credit)

As counterintuitive as it may sound, the majority of my emergency fund will use revolving loans. These loans have relatively low interest rates and I'm taking a somewhat hard stance on what constitutes an emergency; a trip a few months from now is not an emergency and I should try and save what I can before the trip.

I also have a broad definition of cash when it comes to this emergency fund. Money already in risk parity style holdings may be considered cash should an emergency arise. (For the purposes of tracking, they will not be considered cash, however.) These minor holdings should have the lowest risk and volatility while achieving a higher rate of return compared to liquid cash. As such, only 3 to 6 months will be in liquid cash while in accumulation mode, which would shift to roughly 12 months in drawdown mode.

These long-term savings accounts, if you will, arr also used to save for and replace things like my cellphone, laptop, and so on. These tools will only be replaced if the current version no longer serves its intended purpose in my life. I’m other words, just because I’ve saved enough and there's a new model, doesn't mean I should buy it. 

### Credit cards

All credit cards intended for day-to-day use will have a reward system; usually cash back. Credit cards intended for emergency use only should be as low interest as possible as they may carry a balance from one statement period to the next.

Most purchases and spending will be done using credit cards. 

All cards, except the primary, will have cash back funds automatically converted and deposited regularly. The primary card may hold up to 200 USD worth of points before some, if not all, of those points need to be converted to cash.

## Housing and paying off debt

- Monthly housing expenses will be less than or equal to 25-30% of my net income.
- I will not seek to own my own home unless it is part of an assisted living or subletting strategy.
- Debt will be avoided when possible and paid off as soon as possible (preferring immediate payoff).
- Maintain at least a 10% contribution per paycheck to savings and investments.

## Spend and giving

- I'll use the [Building Wealth Paycheck to Paycheck](/finances/building-wealth-paycheck-to-paycheck/) method to help automate these decisions and habits.
- This method will be used every time income is received.
- Contributions will be done in a way that helps maintain desired asset allocations and tax location.

## Changes

- This policy will be revisited regularly.
- Will be changed based on the financial goal being pursued first.
