# April 15th, 2022 paycheck

{!! dateblock !!}

{!! data !!}

## Taxes

Forgot to give the accountant an [IP PIN](https://www.irs.gov/identity-theft-fraud-scams/retrieve-your-ip-pin), so, cutting it a bit close for filing this year.

With that said, M1 Finance sent me a corrected 1099. Not sure if this is normal, but pretty sure it’s another reason to shut the account down.

I’ve never had a corrected 1099 and I don’t appreciate how close to the filing deadline it was.

## 401k

Still [buying the dip](https://joshbruce.com/finances/building-wealth-paycheck-to-paycheck/20220401/#buying-the-dip) by selling out of the large-cap fund and into the small- and mid-cap funds.

## The market

My experience so far is that there’s usually a dip in the middle of the month and a rally at the beginning. I saw it again at the beginning of April, but it didn’t stick like it in previous months.

With that said, it’s still more of a plateau and up a little bit from  last month. 

## Odd place

I’m feeling a bit better. 

## FI experiments

Details are in the [January 15th, 2022 paycheck](https://joshbruce.com/finances/building-wealth-paycheck-to-paycheck/20220115/#fi-experiments).

The hypothesis is when the Mark 0.0 mix is down, it‘ll be down more than the others. Further, when the Mark 0.0 is up, the others will be up and not too far behind the Mark 0.0. We will track the change since the previous paycheck as well as the change since we started tracking January 2022.
