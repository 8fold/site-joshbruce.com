# April 15th, 2022 paycheck

{!! dateblock !!}

{!! data !!}

## Taxes

Forgot to give the accountant an [IP PIN](https://www.irs.gov/identity-theft-fraud-scams/retrieve-your-ip-pin), so, cutting it a bit close for filing this year.

With that said, M1 Finance sent me a corrected 1099. Not sure if this is normal, but pretty sure it’s another reason to shut the account down.

I’ve never had a corrected 1099 and I don’t appreciate how close to the filing deadline it was.

## 401k

Still [buying the dip](https://joshbruce.com/finances/building-wealth-paycheck-to-paycheck/20220401/#buying-the-dip) by selling out of the large-cap fund and into the small- and mid-cap funds.

## The market

My experience so far is that there’s usually a dip in the middle of the month and a rally at the beginning. I saw it again at the beginning of April, but it didn’t stick like it has in previous months.

With that said, it’s still more of a plateau and up a little bit from  last month. 

## Odd place

I’m feeling a bit better. 

## Work

I love what I do. It’s hella frustrating at times though. Anyway, this is more about work in general.

I’ve never gotten an interview from an application via my résumé. On paper, I’m kinda crap; at least when written by me with input from others.

I’ve asked for, and taken a lot of advice over the years. And, I’m going to try and do something different.

First, I’ve decided to hire a professional résumé writer. To be fair, I’m hiring two. While I’m not actively pursuing other employment yet, I’m always open to possibilities and I want to try something I haven’t tried before.

Seriously, over 20 years with applying via résumé and I’ve never received an interview that way. In the beginning I got my jobs by filling out the standard application. When I did full-time freelance, it was an accidental email and word-of-mouth. My father got me my first white collar job interview; I didn’t get that gig but I impressed someone on the panel enough that he decided he had to find me a job there. After getting laid off he got me hired back the second time. Every other time was via temporary agencies or a recruiter randomly calling me. Never a job or company I chose and sent my résumé to.

Second, I’m bailing on most social media. A couple of the industry professionals I talked to mentioned the importance of getting on Twitter, reaching out to friends and family via social; because they’ll never turn you down, so to speak.

To be fair, this was good advice and worked for them. However, as with most things, what works for one, doesn’t work for all; survivorship bias is real. I’ve been online since 1998. In that time I’ve received one interview based on my activity online; it was not a job I applied for—someone found me. Granted this was right at the dot-com bubble bursting, so, that fell through. I never realized how much this could negatively impact my perception of self-worth. One portion of the advice was to add value.

Here’s the thing, I think everything I do could add value to someone. With that said, I also recognize that value is purely subjective; no one can tell you what is valuable to you.

I often see this with teams I coach. For example, a popular refrain is: This meeting doesn’t add value to me.

(I don’t know why my brain went here, but I’ll commit to continuing.)

The meeting is a container, it has no stake or agency with which to create value. Therefore, the question I have is: What did you do to try and bring value to others in the meeting (or space)?

That’s a hard thing to think about or consider. I need to consider the audience and try to be of service to them; instead of waiting (or demanding) they be of service to me first before I reciprocate. If everyone approaches that meeting with that stance, no one delivers value.

Now imagine the Earth as that meeting, that container. Everyone waiting for others to deliver value to them before giving of themselves.

Not the world I’d want to live in.

## FI experiments

Details are in the [January 15th, 2022 paycheck](https://joshbruce.com/finances/building-wealth-paycheck-to-paycheck/20220115/#fi-experiments).

The hypothesis is when the Mark 0.0 mix is down, it‘ll be down more than the others. Further, when the Mark 0.0 is up, the others will be up and not too far behind the Mark 0.0. We will track the change since the previous paycheck as well as the change since we started tracking January 2022.
