## FI experiments

I started multiple portfolios as a single deposit experiment as a sort of control group for the plan going from now until becoming financially independent. 

The Mark 0.0 portfolio holds the 100 percent stock index fund split. The smaller split is 34 percent in a total stock market fund, which favors large-cap growth. The larger split is 66 percent in a total stock market fund (billed as "extended market"), which favors small- and mid-cap equities. This combination results in a roughly even distribution bet

I'm going to start tracking the paycheck-to-paycheck changes in the FI experimental portfolios.

These portfolios don't have contributions made to them regularly. They also don't have withdrawals taken from them. The purpose is primarily to confirm that fluctuations have the desired result. The Mark 0.0 portfolio should be the most volatile while the Mark 1.0 portfolio should not dip as far down as the Mark 0.0 while keeping decent pace when going up.

## End or year reflections

2021 was mainly about:

- setting up forever relationships,
- major purchases (resetting), and 
- settling in on numbers.

### Forever relationships

When it comes to finances I always recommend finding what I call forever-institutions. These are institutions I believe I can stick with for at least 10 years or more. I know what my dealbreakers are and they mainly revolve around my values and principles. One of those principles is:

> Never enter anything without an exit strategy.

That's why I tend to have multiple providers.

My primary financial institution has been my primary institution for almost 30 years. The president recently retired. I'm keeping an eye open for changes that might result to make sure they will continue to be my forever institution.

My secondary financial institution is new, however, I believe it things go pear-shaped with my primary then I'll be able to easily convert the secondary to being my primary.

My tertiary financial institution has been with me for almost 20 years. They handle my insurance policies as well. 

My primary credit card is with the secondary institution. My secondary credit card is through Apple and I've been using their other products and services for over a decade. My tertiary credit card is with the tertiary financial institution. My quaternary credit card with my primary institution.

My business account is with the secondary institution as well. I'm looking to transfer the business credit card to them and close out the one I currently have; mainly because it's not with what I consider a forever-institution.

I'm satisfied with my primary, secondary, and tertiary brokerage providers; however, they're all new to me, so, that could change at any moment. I've had a chance to interact with their customer service multiple times and have had no issues. My Roth [.Individual Retirement Account](IRA) was with my tertiary institution, however, I wasn't satisfied with the folks they transferred it to and transferred it to my primary broker. I was lucky enough to discover a Traditional IRA as well, which was rolled into the primary broker.

The HSA provider institution problem is being resolved. And I dissolved my relationship on that score.

Dropped Intuit like a bad habit and shifted to various financial tools and providers I think I can stick with, including [Wave](https://www.waveapps.com) as the accounting replacement. While there are some issues, they're not nearly to the degree I was having with Intuit products; reminding me that just because it's popular or "professional" doesn't mean it's worth the investment (monetary or emotional).

### Major purchases

Because I'm looking to reduce spending and increase savings I went ahead and purchased a lot of items during the year. New clothes, electronics, household items, and so on. 

This gave me a chance to look at average useful life and set up my distributions in such a way that when I need to replace them later, I'll already have the funds available.

### Settling in on numbers

I'm appreciating the lightweight approach to categorizing expenses I've settled on. It's giving me the insights I think are helpful.

For example, I really need to cut down on eating out. Next to housing-related expenses, eating out is my next highest; followed closely by purchasing regular food.

Because of the aforementioned throughout this entry, 2021 will hopefully be an anomaly and 2022 will see more consistency and fall off in certain areas. For example, earlier this year I spent the money to buy into a lifetime membership to an organization. That was over 1,000 USD. That made membership fees my fourth highest category. So, basically, housing, dining, food, then memberships. That's out of the ordinary and shouldn't be the case moving forward.
