# January 15th, 2022 paycheck

{!! dateblock !!}

{!! data !!}

When my net worth was in the negative, I wasn't too worried about legacy and documenting things; probably not the wisest course of action. My finances would be pretty easy for anyone to deal with and close out my business with the living. Now though, it's more complex. 

Brokerage accounts, retirement accounts, personal and business accounts, and so on. After looking around for solutions to help automate this process, I came across three things:

1. [Family Emergency Binder](https://smartmoneymamas.com/ice-binder/): This is the one I actually purchased to get a feel but, if you do a search you can find a lot of resources along this line.
2. [FidSafe](https://www.fidsafe.com): An as of now free place to store documents and grant access to those documents via encrypted cloud storage.
3. [Living Together by NOLO](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/living-together): Becca and I have no plans to get married, however, this can be problematic in the United States (not sure about elsewhere) when it comes to hospital stays and decision making on behalf of each other.

During 2021, I didn't get much traction on putting these together because that wasn't really the focus for that year.

## Retirement accounts 

Contribution limits for some retirement accounts this year have gone up. 1,000 [.United States Dollars](USD) [for the 401k](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-announces-401k-limit-increases-to-20500). Only 50 USD [for the [.Health Savings Account](HSA)](https://www.fool.com/retirement/plans/hsa/contribution-limits/). No change for the Roth [Individual Retirement Account](IRA).

The income limits for being able to contribute the full amount to a Roth IRA [has also gone up](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/amount-of-roth-ira-contributions-that-you-can-make-for-2022) 4,000 USD [compared to 2021](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/amount-of-roth-ira-contributions-that-you-can-make-for-2021). The math to figure out the amount you can contribute if you fall into the reduced amount level still seems confusing as hell. If I find myself getting close to that amount, I’ll probably just ask for an insane raise that would push out of qualifying even after maxing out contributions to other vehicles. 

I’m setting 401k contributions to 17 percent. When I called Fidelity that was the percent they said would get me close over the course of my paychecks without counting bonuses. 15 percent was my estimate based on the 19,500 USD contribution limit and seemed to be a decent sweet spot for the net paycheck amount. It also helps ensure I get the full employer match as my plan doesn’t offer a [true-up provision](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ashleaebeling/2017/05/26/beware-these-401k-match-traps/?sh=714f64c391c6I’ve heard debate whether it’s better).

Research seems to indicate that lump-sum investing could beat out dollar cost averaging by 2.3 percent in returns, however, increases the potential for losses; as summarized in [this Forbes article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertberger/2021/02/12/dollar-cost-averaging-vs-lump-sum-investing-how-to-decide/?sh=5d861c917c50). Given the time scale I’m looking at is 10 years—around 20 years given what I’m driving toward—and I’m not worried about a 20 year depression at this point, I’m thinking I’ll lump-sum my Roth IRA contribution for 2022. In 2021 I maxed out early in the year, which meant I could take advantage of the dips later in the year. This year, I have the too much cash problem and converting quickly seems beneficial. That’s presuming the [.Internal Revenue Service](IRS) determines I don’t owe a mess-ton of money. 

Depending on the verdict from the IRS, I may do lump-sum with the HSA.

Basically, I’m thinking 2022 will be the lump-sum investing year for the Roth IRA and HSA.

Given the last year, it appears there’s a dip in the middle of each month, which is when I’ll plan to do the lump-sum contributions; most likely around the time I file taxes. I’ll continue dollar cost averaging into the taxable accounts.

## Too much cash

When I was still getting back to broke, I never thought I’d say I had too much cash. When I first started tracking things via [Personal Capital](https://www.personalcapital.com), the retirement planning feature had roughly a 98 percent success rate—now it shows 78 percent.

Three things happened during the drop in success probability. The first is I started holding all this cash. The second is a serious dip in the market. The third is the continued change toward my target allocation. 

I’m discounting the impact of the allocation for now because the success probability didn’t change while I was moving toward the allocation; the drop seemed to happen almost over night.

That leaves the dip in the market and the cash. Unfortunately, the market is recovering just fine and every standard portfolio provided by Personal Capital is outperforming mine by a few percentage points whereas before they were all within a couple of percentage points. 

With that as the rationale, I’m blaming holding so much cash as the issue and will be doing what I can to rectify the situation with a quickness while still allowing for the possibility the IRS will find I owe money somehow or someway.

## FI experiments

I started multiple portfolios as a single deposit experiment as a sort of control group for the plan going from now until becoming financially independent. 

The Mark 0.0 portfolio holds the 100 percent stock index fund split. The smaller split is 34 percent in a total stock market fund, which favors large-cap growth. The larger split is 66 percent in a total stock market fund (billed as "extended market"), which favors small- and mid-cap equities. This combination results in a roughly even distribution between small-, mid-, and large-cap stocks. This is in keeping with the [investment policy](/finances/investment-policy/) and the [macro-allocation](/finances/#principles) and time-in, not timing the market principles.

The Mark 1.0 portfolio holds a risk-parity style portfolio split between 50 percent 100 percent stock index fund (see Mark 0.0), 25 percent in negative correlation (long-term treasuries), 13 percent gold, 6 percent commodities, and 3 percent in both United States and international real estate.

The portfolio between Mark 0.0 and 1.0 start introducing the other components by reducing the amount allocated to the equities. The 1.1 and 1.2 introduce a different commodities setup. Specifically, I different fund at either 6 percent or the entire 13 percent.
