## FI experiments

I started multiple portfolios as a single deposit experiment as a sort of control group for the plan going from now until becoming financially independent. 

The Mark 0.0 portfolio holds the 100 percent stock index fund split. The smaller split is 34 percent in a total stock market fund, which favors large-cap growth. The larger split is 66 percent in a total stock market fund (billed as "extended market"), which favors small- and mid-cap equities. This combination results in a roughly even distribution bet

I'm going to start tracking the paycheck-to-paycheck changes in the FI experimental portfolios.

These portfolios don't have contributions made to them regularly. They also don't have withdrawals taken from them. The purpose is primarily to confirm that fluctuations have the desired result. The Mark 0.0 portfolio should be the most volatile while the Mark 1.0 portfolio should not dip as far down as the Mark 0.0 while keeping decent pace when going up.
