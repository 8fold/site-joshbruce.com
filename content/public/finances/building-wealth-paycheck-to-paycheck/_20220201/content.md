# February 1st, 2022 paycheck

{!! dateblock !!}

{!! data !!}

In 2021 I started using [Wave](https://www.waveapps.com) as my primary accounting platform after my fallout with Intuit. Because of my [consolidated approach to categorizing](/finances/budgeting/) transactions I was able to identify areas where I should adjust with regard to spending and saving. Let's focus on the saving piece as mentioned in the last [paycheck entry](/finances/building-wealth-paycheck-to-paycheck/20220115/#too-much-cash).

Because of the minimal categories I could quickly see which expenses were more of a one-off for that year and probably not something I wanted to progress into the future. Because all the expenses were tracked by the software I was also able to see exactly how much I had spent overall. Subtracting the one-off expenses from the total, I was able to readjust my projected retirement needs in [Personal Capital](https://www.personalcapital.com/?variant=bright-hp), which caused the estimated success rate to go from 78 percent to 98 percent probability of success. 

Personal Capital uses the [You Index™️](https://support.personalcapital.com/hc/en-us/articles/201169610-What-is-the-You-Index-), which looks at what I actually have syncing with them. When I go to [Portfolio Charts](https://portfoliocharts.com/portfolio/portfolio-matrix/) and plug in the Mark 1 portfolio asset allocation, that portfolio still outranks the comparative portfolios available. 

The ability to see income versus expenses reenforces the notion of [budgeting](/finances/budgeting/) as a means of tracking (not dieting) as well as the idea of looking at a net worth statement that Brian and Bo from [The Money Guy Show](https://www.moneyguy.com/resources/) (and others in the financial planning space) are often talking about.

## FI experiments

Details are in the [January 15th, 2022 paycheck](https://joshbruce.com/finances/building-wealth-paycheck-to-paycheck/20220115/#fi-experiments).

The hypothesis is when the Mark 0.0 mix is down, it‘ll be down more than the others. Further, when the Mark 0.0 is up, the others will be up and not too far behind the Mark 0.0. We will track the change since the previous paycheck as well as the change since we started tracking.

For this paycheck the Mark 0 is down just over 5 percent, however, the Mark 1 mixes are only down 3 percent.
