# February 1st, 2022 paycheck

{!! dateblock !!}

{!! data !!}

A lot going on here.

In 2021 I started using [Wave](https://www.waveapps.com) as my primary accounting platform after my [fallout with Intuit](/finances/building-wealth-paycheck-to-paycheck/20220101/). Because of my [consolidated approach to categorizing transactions](/finances/budgeting/) I was able to identify areas where I should adjust spending and saving. Let's focus on the saving piece as mentioned in the previous[paycheck](/finances/building-wealth-paycheck-to-paycheck/20220115/#too-much-cash).

Because of the minimal categories I saw which expenses were more of a one-off for that year and not something I wanted to progress into the future. Because all the expenses were tracked by Wave I was able to see how much I spent. Subtracting the one-off expenses from the total, I was able to adjust my projected retirement needs in [Personal Capital](https://www.personalcapital.com/?variant=bright-hp), which caused the estimated success rate to go from 78 percent back to 98 percent probability of success; at least until the most recent dip, which qualifies as a correction or, possibly, a bear market.

Personal Capital uses the [You Index™️](https://support.personalcapital.com/hc/en-us/articles/201169610-What-is-the-You-Index-), which looks at what the accounts I have synced with them. When I go to [Portfolio Charts](https://portfoliocharts.com/portfolio/portfolio-matrix/) and plug in the Mark 1 portfolio asset allocation, that portfolio outranks the comparative portfolios available.

The ability to see income versus expenses reenforces the notion of [budgeting](/finances/budgeting/) as a means of tracking (not restricting) spending to establish the total cost of lifestyle number. Further, I'm appreciating the idea of looking at a net worth statement each year proposed by Brian and Bo from [The Money Guy Show](https://www.moneyguy.com/resources/) (and others in the financial planning space).

Over time, the upper bands for both debt and cash should decrease. This is because the maximum is based on a percentage of the portfolio's value. As the value increases, the maximums should decrease; 1 percent of 100 [.United States Dollars](USD) is a lot different than 1 percent of 10,000 USD. In other words, my spending won’t change much, however, as a percentage of the portfolio, it'll be less.

## Closing things up since last time

### Health Savings Account

The transfer from HealthSavings Administrators went through for my [.Health Savings Account](HSA). I lost roughly 2 USD from the original contribution and I’m okay with that.

The primary purpose of the move was to get away from HealthSavings Administrators. Further, the price I’m buying in at is lower than when initially bought in, so, it should come out in the wash.

### Too much cash

With the HSA transfer compote, that dropped my cash holdings a bit as I immediately bought the extended market fund in the HSA. Further, I contributed the maximum for 2022.

I received my W2 and it looks like I'm safe to finish contributing to the Roth [.Individual Retirement Account](IRA) for 2021, and I did.

I emptied the cash padding in the M1 Finance settlement account and preemptively purchased the pies there; so, with the next paycheck I'm hoping to bring the settlement account back to where it is normally.

On the Monday before getting paid, the market was down; more like it was staying level for what I carry. I took my cash down a bit further to put a bit more into the taxable account.

## Taxes

Documents should start becoming available in February. I keep forgetting that there’s a standard deduction, which reduces my taxable income. Standard deduction is important to remember because of the Roth IRA income limits restricting contributions.

## Credit cards

All but one of my credit cards is a cash rewards card.

I cashed out my primary card, which had about 200 USD in points available, and put the money in the savings account of my secondary institution. This money will help to purchase the new mattress when we move.

I decided to updated the [investment policy](/finances/investment-policy/#emergency-fund-cash-and-credit) to account for the operation of the credit card reward points.

## Site updates

I finally got around to updating the visualization for the portfolio. I decided against the image methodology [I initially considered](/finances/building-wealth-paycheck-to-paycheck/20210301/); I still have the visualization in the spreadsheet. Hope you enjoy the visualization and I was pretty happy with it from a [web development](/web-development/) perspective because I kept the same markup and, because it's built with a template using the same data, all the previous pages were automatically updated; this isn't particularly new or exciting as it's been a part of web development for years, but it's sometimes the little things that bring the most joy.

I increased the maximum allowed for debt to 1 percent because I pay for most things with credit cards and rarely are they paid off prior to publishing, despite being paid off each paycheck.

## FI experiments

Details are in the [January 15th, 2022 paycheck](https://joshbruce.com/finances/building-wealth-paycheck-to-paycheck/20220115/#fi-experiments).

The hypothesis is when the Mark 0.0 mix is down, it‘ll be down more than the others. Further, when the Mark 0.0 is up, the others will be up and not too far behind the Mark 0.0. We will track the change since the previous paycheck as well as the change since we started tracking.

## The market

I think this is the first correction and potential bear market I'm living through as an investor. With that said, I remember a family member who was saving for retirement during both the 2001 crash and the 2008 recession. And I distinctly remember them saying:

> I just lost 15,000 USD.

I also remember both events leaving a lasting impression on them and their outlook on the stock market and investing. To be fair, I don't know much beyond the single event and statement as we didn't talk much about it after that.

I've heard it said by multiple parties that the best thing that could happen is you start investing during a downturn with a long time horizon. I'm thinking this applies to me.

While I started contributing to my 401k two years ago, it wasn't until 2021 that I started really pouring my money into investments and preparing for the future.

The oldest money I'm looking to have will be 30 years old by the time I reach 72 and begin drawing from my tax-free accounts. The money in tax-deferred accounts will be roughly 20 years old before I start drawing down from them. And, the youngest money will be 10 years old.

Given my age and time horizon, the bulk of my financial net worth will come from me putting money in by the time I, theoretically, begin drawing down. That's why, right now, I'm taking this as an opportunity to buy low. In the 100 year history of the stock market there are always voice that say, it will never go higher than it is right now, or, it'll never get that high again. And yet, when we look at the valuation of the securities in the US stock market, they keep going up.

From what I understand, there have been 4 crashes over the 100 years of the exchange's existence. Bear markets occurs every few years. And, there's a correction about every 16 months.

With that in mind, and only having history as an indication, I would expect to see at least 1 crash, 4 or 5 bear markets, and 23 corrections by the time I start drawing down on my tax-free accounts at age 72.

The harder question is how long will the recovery take, at least for the equities portion of the portfolio. Using the Mark 1 portfolio to backtest, the longest drawdown was a few years. Using the Mark 0 portfolio, it could be a decade or more.

I'm not you, this is not advice. This is me considering for myself to myself. If my life were different, I might feel different. However, as of right now, the path still seems sound.
