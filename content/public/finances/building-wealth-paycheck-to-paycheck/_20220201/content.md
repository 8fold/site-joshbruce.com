{!! data !!}

## FI experiments

The hypothesis is that when the Mark 0.0 mix is down, it will be down more than the others. Further, when the Mark 0.0 is up, the others will be up and not too far behind the Mark 0.0. We will track the change since the previous paycheck as well as the change since we started tracking.

For this paycheck the Mark 0 is down just over 5 percent, however, the Mark 1 mixes are only down 3 percent.
