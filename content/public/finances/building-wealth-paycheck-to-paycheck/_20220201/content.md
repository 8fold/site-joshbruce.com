# February 1st, 2022 paycheck

{!! dateblock !!}

{!! data !!}

In 2021 I started using [Wave](https://www.waveapps.com) as my primary accounting platform after my [fallout with Intuit](/finances/building-wealth-paycheck-to-paycheck/20220101/). Because of my [consolidated approach to categorizing transactions](/finances/budgeting/) I identified areas where I should adjust spending and saving. Let's focus on the saving piece as mentioned in the previous[paycheck](/finances/building-wealth-paycheck-to-paycheck/20220115/#too-much-cash).

Minimal categories allowed me to see which expenses were more of a one-off for 2021 and something I wanted to minimize in 2022. Subtracting one-off expenses from my total expenses, I adjusted my projected retirement needs in [Personal Capital](https://www.personalcapital.com/?variant=bright-hp), which caused the estimated success rate to go from 78 percent back to 98 percent probability of success.

Personal Capital uses the [You Index™️](https://support.personalcapital.com/hc/en-us/articles/201169610-What-is-the-You-Index-), which looks at what I actually have syncing with them. When I go to [Portfolio Charts](https://portfoliocharts.com/portfolio/portfolio-matrix/) and plug in the Mark 1 portfolio asset allocation, that portfolio still outranks the comparative portfolios available.

The ability to see income versus expenses reenforces the notion of [budgeting](/finances/budgeting/) as a means of tracking (not restricting) as well as the idea of looking at a net worth statement each year proposed by Brian and Bo from [The Money Guy Show](https://www.moneyguy.com/resources/) (and others in the financial planning space).

Over time, the allowed maximum for both debt and cash should decrease. This is because the maximum is based on an overall percentage of the portfolio's value. As the balance increases, the maximums should decrease; 1 percent of 100 [.United States Dollars](USD) is a lot different than 1 percent of 10,000 USD. In other words, my spending won’t change much, however, as a percentage of the overall portfolio, it will be less.

## Health Savings Account

The transfer from HealthSavings Administrators went through. I did lose roughly 2 USD from the original contribution and I’m okay with that. 

The primary purpose of the move was to get away from HealthSavings Administrators. Further, the price I’m buying in at seems lower than when initially bought in, so, it should all come out in the wash, so to speak.

Beyond buying into the extended market fund in my Health Savings Account, I went ahead and did a final contribution to my Roth Individual Retirement Account for 2021 and preemptively bought in to the M1 Finance pies. 

These moves were primarily to bring the cash portion into the 5 percent arena and help being the equities more in line with their targets as well.

## The market

I’m still watching the markets and it’s interesting to see things shift. Further, it’s interesting to note that the psychology of it is a desire I feel to jump in sooner rather than later.

I was watching [Graham Stephan](https://youtu.be/LLKg24IVuhc) and, cognitive bias being what it is, I think the interpretation of various reports he points to is correct.

In short, when The United States Federal Reserve lowers interest rates people are more willing to take on riskier and more speculative investments and purchases. When the interest rates go up, people tend to move from growth to value when it comes to equities. This is partially due to lower risk alternatives, like bonds, tending to have higher yields and becoming more appealing. 

The term “normalizing event” was thrown out there and I need to see if this is a term to add to [my lexicon](/finances/concepts/#glossary). Is it the same as a correction, a bear market, or crash? (Decided to start a glossary, see previous link.)

The approach I’m going for is based on [fundamentals](/finances/); at least for the investments I’m working with. I’m also still on the beginning side of [accumulation, not drawdown](/finances/concepts/#accumulation-drawdown-and-rebalancing). Therefore, I’m not rebalancing through selling one thing and buying another; instead, I’m earning income and buying things that are lower than their target percent. 

Other people, during this time, may be rebalancing and not necessarily exiting.

The oldest money I’ll have invested by the time I withdraw it should be roughly 30 years old, if things go according to plan as of this writing (drawing down taxable accounts around 50 years of age, tax-deferred around 60, and tax-free around 70 the age of the investments will be 10, 20, and 30 years old, respectively). So, as people move from the riskier small- and mid-cap arenas and more toward large-cap, stocks, bonds, and commodities, the price per share decreases for the small- and mod-cap, which decreases the price per share of my index funds.

Bottom line is, contributing the way I am to get to the portfolio balance I’m looking for still ensures, as much as possible, that I’m buying low; presuming the value of the small- and mid-caps will be higher in the future, which they should be due to inflation alone.

## Taxes

Documents should start becoming available in February. I keep forgetting that there’s such a thing as a standard deduction, which reduces my taxable income anyway.

Standard deduction is important to remember because of the Roth Individual Retirement Account income limits restricting contributions. 

With the standard deduction on top of the deductible contributions to other retirement accounts, I’m definitely good for being able to contribute the full amount for the 2021 tax year; I still have 240 USD I can put in for the 2021 tax year. Still planning on back-loading for the 2022 tax year; contributing in 2023.

## Credit cards

All but one of my credit cards is a cash rewards card.

I went ahead and cashed out my primary card, which means over 200 USD into the savings account of my secondary institution. The plan is to move that balance to my operating expense account. I’m expecting to help buy a new mattress for the move and this combined amount will help cover that, which means I should be able to continue investing and reducing the cash balance for essentials. I will leave the balance in the savings account until the next paycheck at least, which should increase the average daily balance used to calculate dividends.)

My secondary and tertiary cards automatically deposit reward points as cash. Having the primary card not do this automatically is a hiding money from myself hack. Maybe I should specify this in my [investment policy](/finances/investment-policy/#emergency-fund-cash-and-credit); specifically, is there a cap on how many points I can sit on that aren’t earning dividends? Right now, the answer is no and I think there should be.

## Site updates

I finally got around to updating the visualization for the portfolio. I decided against the image methodology [I initially considered](/finances/building-wealth-paycheck-to-paycheck/20210301/); I still have the visualization in the spreadsheet.

I increased the maximum allowed for debt to 1 percent because I pay for most things with credit cards and rarely are they paid off prior to publishing, despite being paid off each paycheck.

## FI experiments

Details are in the [January 15th, 2022 paycheck](https://joshbruce.com/finances/building-wealth-paycheck-to-paycheck/20220115/#fi-experiments).

The hypothesis is when the Mark 0.0 mix is down, it‘ll be down more than the others. Further, when the Mark 0.0 is up, the others will be up and not too far behind the Mark 0.0. We will track the change since the previous paycheck as well as the change since we started tracking.
