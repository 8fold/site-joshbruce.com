# February 1st, 2022 paycheck

{!! dateblock !!}

{!! data !!}

In 2021 I started using [Wave](https://www.waveapps.com) as my primary accounting platform after my [fallout with Intuit](/finances/building-wealth-paycheck-to-paycheck/20220101/). Because of my [consolidated approach to categorizing](/finances/budgeting/) transactions I was able to identify areas where I should adjust with regard to spending and saving. Let's focus on the saving piece as mentioned in the last [paycheck entry](/finances/building-wealth-paycheck-to-paycheck/20220115/#too-much-cash).

Because of the minimal categories I could quickly see which expenses were more of a one-off for that year and probably not something I wanted to progress into the future. Because all the expenses were tracked by the software I was also able to see exactly how much I spent overall. Subtracting the one-off expenses from the total, I was able to readjust my projected retirement needs in [Personal Capital](https://www.personalcapital.com/?variant=bright-hp), which caused the estimated success rate to go from 78 percent back to 98 percent probability of success.

Personal Capital uses the [You Index™️](https://support.personalcapital.com/hc/en-us/articles/201169610-What-is-the-You-Index-), which looks at what I actually have syncing with them. When I go to [Portfolio Charts](https://portfoliocharts.com/portfolio/portfolio-matrix/) and plug in the Mark 1 portfolio asset allocation, that portfolio still outranks the comparative portfolios available.

The ability to see income versus expenses reenforces the notion of [budgeting](/finances/budgeting/) as a means of tracking (not dieting) as well as the idea of looking at a net worth statement that Brian and Bo from [The Money Guy Show](https://www.moneyguy.com/resources/) (and others in the financial planning space) often talk about.

Over time, the allowed maximum for both debt and cash should decrease. This is because the maximum is based on an overall percentage of the portfolio's value. As the balance increases, the maximums should decrease; 1 percent of a 100 [.United States Dollars](USD) is a lot different than 1 percent of 10,000 USD.

## Health Savings Account

The transfer from Health Savings Administrators went through.

## The market

I’m still watching the markets and it’s interesting to watch as things shift. 

I was watching [Graham Stephan](https://youtu.be/LLKg24IVuhc) and, cognitive bias being what it is, I think the interpretation is correct.

In short, when The United States Federal lowers interest rates people are more willing to take on riskier and more speculative investments and purchases. When the interest rates go up, people go back to more fundamental-based and lower risk approaches. This is partially due to lower risk alternatives, like bonds, tend to have higher interest rates and become more appealing. 

The term normalizing event was thrown out there.

The approach I’m going for is based on [fundamentals](/finances/); at least for the investments I’m working with. I’m also still on the beginning side of accumulation, not drawdown. Therefore, I’m not rebalancing through selling, I’m doing it through contributing. The oldest money I’ll have invested will be roughly 30 before I have to take required minimum distributions ([72 as of this writing](https://www.investor.gov/financial-tools-calculators/calculators/required-minimum-distribution-calculator)), if things go according to the plan as of this writing (taxable around 50 years of age, tax-deferred around 60, and tax-free around 70).

Bottom line is, contributing the way I am to get to the portfolio balance I’m looking for still ensures, as much as possible, that I’m buying low; presuming the value will be higher in the future, which it should be due to inflation alone.

## Taxes

Documents should start becoming available in February. I keep forgetting that there’s such a thing as a standard deduction, which reduces my taxable income anyway.

This is important to remember because of the Roth Individual Retirement Account income limits. 

With the standard deduction on top of the deductible contributions to other retirement accounts, I’m definitely good for last year. Still planning on back-loading for this year; contributing in 2023 for the 2022 tax year.

## Site updates

I finally got around to updating the visualization for the portfolio. I decided against the image methodology [I initially considered](/finances/building-wealth-paycheck-to-paycheck/20210301/); I still have the visualization in the spreadsheet.

I increased the maximum allowed for debt because I pay for most things with credit cards and rarely are they paid off prior to publishing, despite being paid off each paycheck.

## FI experiments

Details are in the [January 15th, 2022 paycheck](https://joshbruce.com/finances/building-wealth-paycheck-to-paycheck/20220115/#fi-experiments).

The hypothesis is when the Mark 0.0 mix is down, it‘ll be down more than the others. Further, when the Mark 0.0 is up, the others will be up and not too far behind the Mark 0.0. We will track the change since the previous paycheck as well as the change since we started tracking.
