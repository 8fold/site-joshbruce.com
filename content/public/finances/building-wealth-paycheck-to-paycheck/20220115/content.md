## FI experiments

I started multiple portfolios as a single deposit experiment as a sort of control group for the plan going from now until becoming financially independent. 

The Mark 0.0 portfolio holds the 100 percent stock index fund split. The smaller split is 34 percent in a total stock market fund, which favors large-cap growth. The larger split is 66 percent in a total stock market fund (billed as "extended market"), which favors small- and mid-cap equities. This combination results in a roughly even distribution between small-, mid-, and large-cap stocks. This is in keeping with the [investment policy](/finances/investment-policy/) and the [macro-allocation](/finances/#principles) and time-in, not timing the market principles.

The Mark 1.0 portfolio holds a risk-parity style portfolio split between 50 percent 100 percent stock index fund (see Mark 0.0), 25 percent in negative correlation (long-term treasuries), 13 percent gold, 6 percent commodities, and 3 percent in both United States and international real estate.

The portfolio between Mark 0.0 and 1.0 start introducing the other components by reducing the amount allocated to the equities. The 1.1 and 1.2 introduce a different commodities setup. Specifically, I different fund at either 6 percent or the entire 13 percent.
