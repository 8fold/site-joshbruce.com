# April 1st, 2022 paycheck

{!! dateblock !!}

{!! data !!}

Bumped the 401k contribution back up to 15 percent.

## Cash

Before I shifted to using the risk parity portfolios for things like electronics I started down the same cash path I had used for years. This meant opening share certificates with a credit union that I could continue making deposits to.

One matured and I took that money and moved it to the extended market index fund; thereby, reducing the amount of cash on hand.

## Odd place

The longer, and more in-depth, I go with [van life](/van-life/) the more impatient I find myself growing. I’ve never been particularly ambitious when it comes to my career. Things changed a bit when I found myself homeless and in a crazy amount of student loan debt.

The best description I have for where my mind is right now is burned out.

I love what I do. I do believe you can [design a life](/design-your-life/) you don’t need to runaway from. What I’m feeling isn’t trying to run from where I am, but run toward something different.

## FI experiments

Details are in the [January 15th, 2022 paycheck](https://joshbruce.com/finances/building-wealth-paycheck-to-paycheck/20220115/#fi-experiments).

The hypothesis is when the Mark 0.0 mix is down, it‘ll be down more than the others. Further, when the Mark 0.0 is up, the others will be up and not too far behind the Mark 0.0. We will track the change since the previous paycheck as well as the change since we started tracking January 2022.
