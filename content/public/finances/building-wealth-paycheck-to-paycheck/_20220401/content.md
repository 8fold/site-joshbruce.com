# April 1st, 2022 paycheck

{!! dateblock !!}

{!! data !!}

Bumped the 401k contribution back up to 15 percent.

## Cash

Before I shifted to using the risk parity portfolios for things like electronics I started down the same cash path I had used for years. This meant opening share certificates with a credit union that I could continue making deposits to.

One matured and I took that money and moved it to savings. 

I debated buying the extended market index fund per the [buying a dip](/finances/budgeting/#spending-cash-reserves) protocol for spending cash reserves, however, I decided to hold until after speaking with the accountant about my taxes.

## Taxes

The accountant was wonderful and easily managed getting through my documents. 

I qualify for a refund.

This means, once I receive the refund, I’ll perform the distribution as described in [my budgeting protocols](/finances/budgeting/#transferring-from-the-tax-account). So, cash reserves will go down soon, especially if the market stays down. With that said, over the course of this year the cash on hand will be high as I am planning to backload the Roth [.Individual Retirement Account](IRA) for the 2022 tax year.

## Odd place

The longer, and more in-depth, I go with [van life](/van-life/) the more impatient I find myself growing. I’ve never been particularly ambitious when it comes to my career. Things changed a bit when I found myself homeless and in a crazy amount of student loan debt.

The best description I have for where my mind is right now is burned out.

I love what I do. I do believe you can [design a life](/design-your-life/) you don’t need to runaway from. What I’m feeling isn’t trying to run from where I am, but run toward something different.

With that said, given my lifestyle, chances are van life won’t actually be a money saving move. No car payment. Minimal insurance cost. No car-related expenses. All of that changes the moment I get a vehicle and those costs may equal rent and utilities. So, I don’t think the running toward something is financial, it’s just different.

I’m waiting to see if this is just a passing thing or a more general, long running sense of ennui and malaise. If it’s the latter, I’m not sure how I might go about expediting the plan, without endangering the potential for joy in that path.

I think Becca has the right of it though when she said:

> Im trying to not make any life altering changes while there’s still a pandemic going on.

Im hoping to be able set aside a certain amount of time each day toward researching and reflecting on the van life question and working toward and marketing my other work and projects.

## FI experiments

Details are in the [January 15th, 2022 paycheck](https://joshbruce.com/finances/building-wealth-paycheck-to-paycheck/20220115/#fi-experiments).

The hypothesis is when the Mark 0.0 mix is down, it‘ll be down more than the others. Further, when the Mark 0.0 is up, the others will be up and not too far behind the Mark 0.0. We will track the change since the previous paycheck as well as the change since we started tracking January 2022.
