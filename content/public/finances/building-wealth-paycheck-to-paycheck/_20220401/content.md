# April 1st, 2022 paycheck

{!! dateblock !!}

{!! data !!}

Bumped the 401k contribution back up to 17 percent.

## Cash

Before I shifted to using the risk parity portfolios for things like electronics I started down the same cash path I had used for years. This meant opening share certificates with a credit union that I could continue making deposits to.

One matured and I took that money and moved it to savings. 

I debated buying the extended market index fund per the [buying a dip](/finances/budgeting/#spending-cash-reserves) protocol for spending cash reserves, however, I decided to hold until after speaking with the accountant about my taxes.

## Taxes

The accountant was wonderful and easily managed getting through my documents. 

I qualify for a refund.

This means, once I receive the refund, I’ll perform the distribution as described in [my budgeting protocols](/finances/budgeting/#transferring-from-the-tax-account). So, cash reserves will go down soon, especially if the market stays down. With that said, over the course of this year the cash on hand will be high as I am planning to backload the Roth [.Individual Retirement Account](IRA) for the 2022 tax year.

## 401k

My 401k doesn't have the two equity funds I’d like to use (I've asked my employer if they can be added). Therefore, to get the mix I want from the [investment policy](/finances/investment-policy/#investments) I need to have a total small-, mid-, and large-cap fund. 

The short of it is that I initially started with a target retirement fund with 2060 retirement year. I sold out of that position in favor of the large-cap fund. Since then, I've had contributions going into the small- and mid-cap funds to move slowly toward the desired allocation in each.

The large-cap fund has a capital gain of a few thousand dollars and it’ll take roughly two years contributing up to the limit to achieve the target allocation. Because there's a dip in the market and these funds have a time horizon of about 20 years, I've decided to start manual rebalancing.

The small-cap fund is hovering at being about 1,000 USD down from the cost basis. I’ve put 1,000 from the large-cap to small-cap twice. I did the same thing with the mid-cap, which was only down a few hundred dollars.

I'm going to see if I can get to the target allocation before the end of 2022. With that said, it's my understanding I can't take advantage of tax loss harvesting in a 401k account, so, I’ll only move the gains. The benefits, as I see them:

1. not paying capital gains taxes because it's not a withdraw (and the dollar amounts for the year would fall into the 0 percent tax band),
2. I'm taking advantage of buying low and selling high despite being limited in what I can contribute each year (this benefit is because there's more than one fund), and
3. I can continue dollar-cost-averaging through contributions *and* slowly rebalancing.

I'm also considering setting up automatic notifications when the target allocation is off; not automating the rebalancing yet. I've set a calendar event a couple months from now to revisit that consideration.

## Odd place

The longer, and more in-depth, I go with [van life](/van-life/) the more impatient I find myself growing. I’ve never been particularly ambitious when it comes to my career. Things changed a bit when I found myself homeless and in a crazy amount of student loan debt.

The best description I have for where my mind is right now is burned out.

I love what I do. I do believe you can [design a life](/design-your-life/) you don’t need to runaway from. What I’m feeling isn’t trying to run from where I am, but run toward something different.

With that said, given my lifestyle, chances are van life won’t actually be a money saving move. No car payment. Minimal insurance cost. No car-related expenses. All of that changes the moment I get a vehicle and those costs may equal rent and utilities. So, I don’t think the running toward something is financial, it’s just different.

I’m waiting to see if this is just a passing thing or a more general, long running sense of ennui and malaise. If it’s the latter, I’m not sure how I might go about expediting the plan, without endangering the potential for joy in that path.

I think Becca has the right of it though when she said:

> Im trying to not make any life altering changes while there’s still a pandemic going on.

Im hoping to be able set aside a certain amount of time each day toward researching and reflecting on the van life question and working toward and marketing my other work and projects.

## FI experiments

Details are in the [January 15th, 2022 paycheck](https://joshbruce.com/finances/building-wealth-paycheck-to-paycheck/20220115/#fi-experiments).

The hypothesis is when the Mark 0.0 mix is down, it‘ll be down more than the others. Further, when the Mark 0.0 is up, the others will be up and not too far behind the Mark 0.0. We will track the change since the previous paycheck as well as the change since we started tracking January 2022.
