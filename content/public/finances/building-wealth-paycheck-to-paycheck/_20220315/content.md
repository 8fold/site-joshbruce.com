# March 15th, 2022 paycheck

{!! dateblock !!}

{!! data !!}

Reduced 401k allocation to 12 percent. A bonus check came in and there’s still quite a bit of year left. In the future I’ll probably start around 15 percent instead of 17.

Updated the [January 15th paycheck](https://joshbruce.com/finances/building-wealth-paycheck-to-paycheck/20220115/#hsa) entry regarding the [.Health Savings Account](HSA). In short:

> So, the federal contribution limit divided by the number of months I was enrolled in a qualified health plan gives me my actual annual contribution limit.￼

Still not sure what’s going on with the [.United States Internal Revenue Service](IRS). However, I’ve decided to bring in an accountant this year to double-check all the things.

The income tax for Kentucky was taken out, while not devastating on a per paycheck basis, I’m still estimating around 5,000 [.United States Dollars](USD) per year between base pay and bonuses. Which brings us to the rub: possible pay cut. 

Like I said in the [February 15th 2022 paycheck](https://joshbruce.com/finances/building-wealth-paycheck-to-paycheck/20220215/) my employer adjusts pay based on physical address. The back office work has hit the point where I can see the proposed, adjusted salary. It’s a drop of 3 percent for base salary and bonuses.

So, my maximum gross pay would drop 3 percent and my net pay drops by about 5 percent. Estimated inflation is up 7 percent. And my bills at the moment are roughly the same.

Not cool.

My manager and I are making the case for the amounts to be adjusted. Like I said before, we’ll see how this goes.

## FI experiments

Details are in the [January 15th, 2022 paycheck](https://joshbruce.com/finances/building-wealth-paycheck-to-paycheck/20220115/#fi-experiments).

The hypothesis is when the Mark 0.0 mix is down, it‘ll be down more than the others. Further, when the Mark 0.0 is up, the others will be up and not too far behind the Mark 0.0. We will track the change since the previous paycheck as well as the change since we started tracking January 2022.
