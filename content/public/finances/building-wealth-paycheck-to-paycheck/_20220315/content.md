# March 15th, 2022 paycheck

{!! dateblock !!}

{!! data !!}

Reduced 401k allocation to 12 percent. A bonus check came in and there’s still quite a bit of 2022 left. In the future I’ll probably start around 15 percent instead of 17.

Updated the [January 15th paycheck](https://joshbruce.com/finances/building-wealth-paycheck-to-paycheck/20220115/#hsa) entry regarding the [.Health Savings Account](HSA). In short:

> So, the federal contribution limit divided by the number of months I was enrolled in a qualified health plan gives me my actual annual contribution limit.￼

Still not sure what’s going on with the [.United States Internal Revenue Service](IRS). However, I’ve decided to bring in an accountant this year to double-check all the things.

The income tax for Kentucky was taken out of this check, while not devastating on a per paycheck basis, I’m still estimating around 5,000 [.United States Dollars](USD) per year between base pay and bonuses. 

Which brings us to the rub: possible pay cut. 

Like I said in the [February 15th 2022 paycheck](https://joshbruce.com/finances/building-wealth-paycheck-to-paycheck/20220215/) my employer adjusts pay based on physical address. The back office work has hit the point where I can see the proposed, adjusted salary. It’s a drop of 3 percent for base salary and bonuses.

So, my maximum gross pay would drop 3 percent and my net pay drops by about 5 percent. Estimated inflation is up 7 percent. And my bills at the moment are roughly the same.

Not cool.

My manager and I are making the case for the amounts to be adjusted. Like I said before, we’ll see how this goes.

## Shut ’er down

I’ve decided to close my Uphold account, which means selling my [.Basic Attention Tokens](BAT). I’m also pretty sure I’ll be shutting down the M1 Finance account as well.

This tax season along with the continued interaction with the IRS has me really wanting to simplify and consolidate things. A practice I think of as [pruning the trees](/design-your-life/pruning-the-trees); trying these various providers and approaches was growth and exploration.

A while back I grabbed the [Brave browser](https://brave.com). It was interesting to me mainly because the premise is users getting reimbursed for their attention and data; a concept similar to (and possibly inspired by) the work and ideas of [Jaron Lanier](https://www.ted.com/talks/jaron_lanier_how_we_need_to_remake_the_internet). The browser does a good job blocking ads (and optionally showing Brave ads) and, if you activate and sign up for [Brave Rewards](https://brave.com/brave-rewards/) you earn a crypto token called [BAT](https://basicattentiontoken.org). The BAT can be exchanged in various ways using a crypto wallet and exchange. The exchange I used is called [Uphold](https://uphold.com/en-us). When exchanging BAT for USD, it’s just like selling almost anything that can go up or down in value, which means there’s a tax form involved.

With the summary of how I got to having an account with Uphold out of the way, I’m shutting down my account and no longer actively participating in the earning or exchanging of BAT.

When I moved to Kentucky I needed to update my address with all the institutions in my world. They all went as you might expect, until I got to Uphold. 

I couldn’t update the state through the online form. Emailed support who put me through a digitized verification process, which included driver’s license and selfie authentication; which may or may not be security theater or something out of a conspiracy theory, but who knows. Anyway, once verified they want me to send [.personally identifiable information](PII) in the form of updated identification, utility bill, or the rental agreement via unencrypted email. 

The idea of privacy online is pretty much a fantasy. However, after the hoops I jumped through verifying myself, you’re telling me you (or I) can’t just fill out a quick form online? 

I changed my insurance policies, payroll, three bank accounts in as many states, and an Apple Card without having to do the identification plus selfie verification and none of them required I send documentation and, if they did, it wasn’t as an attachment using standard email protocols. The combination of “security is in our DNA” and “send us documentation containing things beyond your new address via email” broke my brain; the first quote being direct the second is a paraphrase. 

So, quick opportunity cost check, decided to close the account, stop using Brave, and stop looking at BAT integrations. One less institution and one less possible tax form and thing to concern myself with. (I do admit, it was nice getting a little something for surfing the internet.)

The choice to shutdown [M1 Finance](https://m1.com) is a bit more straightforward; it’d just be one less vendor and tax form to worry about and wait for. 

I appreciate the platform and ease of use. I don’t appreciate some of the marketing aspects of the company; I said it was okay to send notifications on my phone to see what they’d be and every notification has been a product promotion, meanwhile, when my tax documents were ready, no notification via phone or email (at least I don’t think I got an email). 

This raises the question of where to move those investments.

Right now I’m leaning toward [Fidelity](https://www.fidelity.com) though I’d prefer [Vanguard](https://investor.vanguard.com/corporate-portal/). Fidelity has my 401k and [.Health Savings Account](HSA) while Vanguard has my [.Individual Retirement Accounts](IRAs) and main taxable brokerage account. I’m also considering a combination.

The reason I started the M1 Finance account is that I could easily earmark chunks of value while minimizing the number of underlying investments. 

Even though I have five buckets with M1 Finance, they’re all holding the same 9 underlying investments. M1 Finance made it so I didn’t have to do any of the math, I could just throw money in and go. I’m not sure the overhead cost is worth it now though and the longer I wait, the greater the burden of closing down the account; tax liabilities and whatnot.

So, I need to make the decision soon.

While I continue to contemplate, I’ve simplified the spreadsheet I use a bit more. Data entry should take less time and give a more accurate picture of where more money should be moved. Further, I’ve created my own M1 Finance like method of tracking. This way I can put the money where needed and the spreadsheet fills up insurance deductibles, electronics, van life, and the generic taxable brokerage (retirement bridge) sub-pieces.

Once I move the broader portfolio to the same asset allocation across the board I may find tracking the various fund accounts is unnecessary.

Alternatively, I could open a separate taxable brokerage account for each fund, but I’m appreciating the idea of a minimal number of accounts and sub-accounts. Further, there should come a point where almost everything is under one roof; Vanguard. Two things hold me back from doing it now:

1. The main bit is Vanguard doesn’t offer [dollar-based investing](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/fractional-shares) (or fractional shares) for non-mutual fund vehicles; specifically [.exchange-traded funds](ETFs).
2. My long-term treasuries need to hit a value of 3,000 [.United States Dollars](USD) before I can buy into a the mutual fund at Vanguard.

Arguably, mutual funds are going the way of the dodo and ETFs are their replacement. However, the only way to do fractional shares at Vanguard is using their mutual funds; note, this isn’t the same as investing in Vanguard through purchasing their ETFs elsewhere using fractional shares—like M1 Finance of Fidelity. Further, trading non-Vanguard ETFs at Vanguard is possible commission free, however, the trade must be done at the full share price of the holding; again, not fractional. Even trading Vanguard ETFs at Vanguard is the same way, so, at least the consistently applying the rules.

## FI experiments

Details are in the [January 15th, 2022 paycheck](https://joshbruce.com/finances/building-wealth-paycheck-to-paycheck/20220115/#fi-experiments).

The hypothesis is when the Mark 0.0 mix is down, it‘ll be down more than the others. Further, when the Mark 0.0 is up, the others will be up and not too far behind the Mark 0.0. We will track the change since the previous paycheck as well as the change since we started tracking January 2022.
