# February 15th, 2022 paycheck

{!! dateblock !!}

{!! data !!}

Moved from Tennessee to Kentucky. 

It’ll be interesting from a financial perspective because I’m going from a state with no income tax to a state with income tax. I’m not sure the total impact that’ll have on what I’ll be able to put away.

My employer also has one of those income is adjusted for where you live policies. So, my income could go up, down, or stay the same. I really could see arguments for any of the three. 

Because I’m paying state income tax, I could see my salary going up to maintain a similar net paycheck. Because rent is slightly cheaper, I could see my salary going down. Depending on the estimated impact of both of those, I could see my employer saying they’ll just leave it as it is.

Of course, if they leave it as is, my net pay would probably be less, which I’m not a fan of. With that said, as of this writing, the tax rate is a flat tax of 5 percent, which would be less than the amount I spent on dining out and membership fees last year; both of which I’m planning to receive this year.

Basically, as long as I’m not taking a pay cut, I should be okay.

## Mark 2.0?

I’m considering a new pie for the FI experiments. The premise behind it would be to not consider cash reserves and spending money as something outside the portfolio; a more holistic view, if you will. I’m thinking 5 percent cash, which means the portfolio would look something like this:

- 49 percent US equities. 
- 24.5 percent negative correlation.
- 21.5 percent alternatives.
- 5 percent cash.

The problem is I’m not aware of an [.Exchange Traded Fund](ETF) that would be correlated directly with cash. A money market fund might do it and I’m considering short-term treasury bonds. According to [Portfolio Visualizer](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/asset-correlations) correlations, short-term treasuries have a 0.3 correlation with cash and the money market ETF I tried was around 0.66. 

The correlation is 0.33 with cash, so, it’s at least positively correlated. I did look at a money market ETF as well, and while it’s a higher correlation, it’s not the 1 I was hoping for; basically twice the correlation of the short-term treasuries. 

## FI experiments

Details are in the [January 15th, 2022 paycheck](https://joshbruce.com/finances/building-wealth-paycheck-to-paycheck/20220115/#fi-experiments).

The hypothesis is when the Mark 0.0 mix is down, it‘ll be down more than the others. Further, when the Mark 0.0 is up, the others will be up and not too far behind the Mark 0.0. We will track the change since the previous paycheck as well as the change since we started tracking January 2022.
