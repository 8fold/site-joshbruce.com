# January 1st, 2022 paycheck

{!! dateblock !!}

{!! data !!}

December was a three check month for me. So, I was paid on the seventeenth and again on the thirtieth; a day early because of the new year holiday observation. Therefore, this paycheck is actually two and there’s basically a full paycheck’s worth of money in transit.

And, here we go...

The [.IRS](United States Internal Revenue Service) sent me a letter notifying me that they would like 90 more days. The date the letter was issued was on the ninetieth day from the previous letter. So, yeah, not sure I’m going to continue holding this much cash; more below.

The request to transfer my [.HSA](Health Savings Account) from HealthSavings Administrators was not completed within the three to five weeks. When I called HealthSavings Administrators they explained that they’ve been having issues processing electronic requests and I should request my preferred provider fax them. What a cluster fuck this experience has been; more below. With that said, I hit the maximum contribution for the HSA with the paycheck on the seventeenth. 

Found out I actually didn’t go over the contribution limit for the year on the 401k. It appears like I did because of the difference between the calendar year and the tax year. The first contribution in 2021 was made against the 2020 tax year. So, maxed out 401k for the first time. I hit the maximum with the paycheck on the seventeenth as well, so, this check is a bit larger than I’m used to compared to the rest of the year.

We’re planning on moving. I used some of the cash I’ve had lying around to pay the deposit and first month’s rent. When Becca and I talked about how we’d go about this move we decided I’d take on the full burden of the new place while she did the same for the current place. Therefore, I won’t be paying rent in either place until March; deposit is essentially January rent in current place and first month’s rent is February.

## IRS

In short, I’m pretty sure The Federal Government has spent more processing my 2020 taxes than they will potentially receive. I’m not normally one to throw folks under the bus while also trying to extend a lot of grace and yet...

Earlier this year or late last year I had a serious falling out with [Intuit](https://www.intuit.com). Basically I had an interaction with them that made me feel like they favored people with money over those without. Given my financial history and anti-elitism stance on things, I basically told them I felt the relationship had turned toxic and abusive and we’re breaking up. They still send me emails despite me asking them multiple times to forget I exist and delete all my personal information for the multiple accounts I used to have with them. Believe there was a quotable hot-take in one call that went something like: Poor people deserve good customer service as well.

All right, that’s driving the bus forward over the first problem, what does that have to do with the IRS?

Up until this year, I used Intuit’s TurboTax software to do my taxes. Normally I store a copy of the files return. I was going through my documents and discovered I didn’t have my returns for all previous years. (That’s totally my fault.) 

Well, I’m not about to call Intuit about it, because that’s just gonna open that wound again and I’m not sure I’ve unpacked some of my baggage around money and being poor to deal with that. So, instead I filled out [IRS Form 4506](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-4506) and decided to go ahead do it for as many years back as I could. This was back around April of 2021.

This is a service you pay for when you request the copies. 

Anyhoo, around August I get the letter saying there’s a possible discrepancy. I still haven’t received the copies of the returns. In other words, it feels a bit like I sparked a review of my tax returns. 

So, I’ve paid a couple hundred dollars to get copies of my returns. The IRS says I owe another few thousand despite the extra income I received from my mother’s death is not taxable income because taxes were already paid. This caused me to put some of my investing goals on hold to make sure I’d have enough cash after the ninety days to pay if I needed to. 

I figured ninety days wasn’t that big of a deal. Of course, I wasn’t expecting a letter to come stating they’re gonna go ahead and take up to another ninety days to respond again.

(I’m pretty sure I’m only half kidding that if a full audit was ever run the federal, state, and local governments would probably find they owe me money. I’m the definition of anti-shady.)

So, that’s forward over one body, and back over another. But we’re not done.

## HSA

The HSA as provided by my employer doesn’t have the funds I was looking for. My employer also doesn’t have any type of matching program for the HSA. In other words, it’s fully-funded by me and my employer pays the various fees. 

I decided I’d strike out on my own then. I don’t get the tax deduction until I file, but I think it’s worth it to have the flexibility in choosing my provider and having my preferred investment options available. 

I found [HealthSavings Administrators](https://healthsavings.com) and was pretty impressed. They had the funds I wanted. They didn’t strike me as a big-box company. I was able to call customer service and they seemed nice enough. Opened the account.

Opened the account. Found out I still had a few dollars in another HSA that I thought had been feed out of existence some time ago (money-baggage). Thought I had asked the HSA provider I no longer wanted to close my account and transfer the balance into my HealthSavings account. What I actually did, apparently, was ask the provider I didn’t want to transfer from HealthSavings and for HealthSavings to close my account; despite not communicating with HealthSavings.

## Assets

We're moving to a new city and state. I was asked whether we were planning on owning or renting. I said:

> We're pretty much renters for life, I think.

The response was a good one regarding how many people look at buying a home as an investment, so, what was I planning to do for retirement. Given that you're here, chances are you already know, if you've read the [opening page](/finances) and the [investment policy](/finances/invest-policy), so, I want to take a different tack for this one.

Not that any of us needs a reason beyond wanting and not wanting to do something but, the big thing is, I don't view any use-asset as an investment.

So, beyond the concept of total cost of ownership, why do I rent?

[One of my favorite videos](https://youtu.be/q9Golcxjpi8) on the subject does a good job of going over general research-based pros, cons, and considerations. I'll mainly be looking at what I consider the cons for me and my lifestyle; let's begin.

For me, use-assets aren't investments, I'm using them. They have utility in my life other than financial. If I redeem the cash value for the asset, I lose the utility of that particular asset. This often means I will spend some, if not all, of the money redeemed from the sale of the asset to purchase a different, similar asset. While the home contributes to my net worth on the accounting ledger, there is such a thing as being house rich and retirement poor. I could take out a mortgage to "get the equity" in the home out, however, I now have a loan to pay off with interest and there may be fees involved in the financing of the home. Selling a home can take multiple weeks to accomplish and there are typically fees involved; relatively illiquid. Compare this to withdrawing cash from an account or selling investment shares, which are usually available in less than 7 days. Finally, on the topic of "traditional" investment vehicles, they have no other utility beyond being a holder of value. Sure, they may lose value (capital loss), but the same is true of real estate; see [The Great Recession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession) and [The Housing Bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_housing_bubble). What makes houses odd in terms of use-assets is that they tend to go up in value while other use-assets depreciate—unless held for excessively long periods of time; see [Jay Leno's car collection](https://youtu.be/2rpbkPLkNms) estimated at a fair market value of over [150 million [.USD](United States Dollars)](https://www.hotcars.com/most-expensive-cars-in-jay-lenos-car-collection/). With that said, humans tend to favor simple math when it comes to these sorts of things. I paid 5 USD for this and sold it for 10 USD; I made 5 USD, which doesn't include any taxes, fees, maintenance during ownership, and so on (all the [total cost of ownership](/finances/total-cost-of-ownership) things).

That's the big one for me; use-assets aren't investments, they have more value to me as what they are, not what I can sell them for. Now for some of the smaller ones, in no particular order.

I appreciate the advice from [The Money Guy Show](https://www.moneyguy.com) when they say owning a home a long-term consideration. If you're not looking to be there for at least five years, it may be better to have the flexibility afforded by renting housing and not owning. I tend to move every 2 or 3 years. Sometimes it's just from one city to another, but I don't see myself setting up roots, so to speak.

I don't like tinkering or maintenance activities. Generally speaking, I don't modify the places I live in; rarely even painting the walls (or hanging things on them to be honest). So, restrictions in this regard don't typically affect my happiness or experience in a place. I've also never had a landlord deny me the request to do something. Some maintenance falls into the total cost of ownership conversation for another time but to hit on it briefly, if the washing machine needs replaced, I don't typically pay for that. New toilets? Not me. Dishwasher goes out? Not it. Exterior needs painting? Not me either. Some people enjoy theses things, I'm not one of them.

This one might be a bit more controversial; I like being or knowing who owns the thing I'm using. Ultimately, the federal, state, and local governments own the homes we live in and the land they're on. If you don't pay property taxes, the house and lot will be taken from you. If you don't pay the fees of the Home Owner's Association (if there is one), bad things can happen, up to and including being removed from the community (sounds like eviction from a rental). If you don't pay the mortgage, the bank will cease the house. I can definitively say I own my cellular phone; I can't do that with larger assets like a home or car. With renting an apartment or home I know the landlord. I delegate a lot of responsibility to them so I don't have to think about it or spend my time doing it. (And, just to be clear, I have a lot of say in who I choose as a landlord, so, as long as I don't choose Scrooge, it's been pretty okay.)
