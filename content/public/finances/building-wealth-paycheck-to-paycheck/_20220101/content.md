# December 15th, 2021 paycheck

{!! dateblock !!}

{!! data !!}

This one is going to be a bit odd from a numbers perspective. I was paid again on the seventeenth before I published this article. December is a three check month for me.

So, the cash includes a paycheck that technically wasn't there on the fifteenth. However, it shouldn't cause too much of a problem I don't think.

The 90 days for the [.IRS](Internal Revenue Service) was up on the eighth. That includes weekends though, so, I'm giving it a few more days until I call to check status and confirm the all clear.

Transferring my [.HSA](Health Savings Account) has been finished yet. Will be calling them regarding that.

About to hit the maximum on 401k contributions. Need to email my employer to confirm what happens then.

Beyond that, pretty boring and the [.FI](Financial Independence) portfolios are proving themselves out as it relates to the risk parity portfolio concept. The 100 percent equities portfolio shows down roughly 3 percent while the risk parity should down only a little over 1 percent. I think I will start doing paycheck-to-paycheck comparisons similar to what Frank Vasquez does with the portfolios on [Risk Parity Radio](https://www.riskparityradio.com). I think it would be a better way for comparison and tracking over time; especially since I did the contribution accidentally the other day and started two of them after all the others. I can't tell if the others are actually doing better, or if it's just because they haven't been around as long.

So, yeah, pretty boring.

## Assets

We're moving to a new city and state. I was asked whether we were planning on owning or renting. I said:

> We're pretty much renters for life, I think.

The response was a good one regarding how many people look at buying a home as an investment, so, what was I planning to do for retirement. Given that you're here, chances are you already know, if you've read the [opening page](/finances) and the [investment policy](/finances/invest-policy), so, I want to take a different tack for this one.

I don't view any use-asset as an investment.

So, beyond the concept of total cost of ownership, why do I rent?

[One of my favorite videos](https://youtu.be/q9Golcxjpi8) on the subject does a good job here. Let's begin.

For me, use assets aren't investments, I'm using them. They have utility. If I redeem the cash value for the asset, I lose the utility of that asset, unless I get another asset providing the same or similar utility. While the home contributes to my net worth on the accounting ledger, there is such a thing as being house rich and retirement poor. I could take out a mortgage to "get the equity" in the home, however, I now have a loan to pay off with interest and there may be fees involved in the financing of the home. Selling a home can take multiple weeks to accomplish and there are typically fees involved. Compare this to withdrawing cash from an account or selling investment shares, which are usually available in less than 7 days. Finally, on this topic, those investments have no other utility for me than being a holder of value. Sure, they may lose value, but real estate can lose value; see [The Great Recession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession) and [The Housing Bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_housing_bubble). What makes houses odd in terms of use assets is that they tend to go up in value while other depreciateâ€”unless held for excessively long periods of time; see [Jay Leno's car collection](https://youtu.be/2rpbkPLkNms) estimated at a fair market value of over [150 million [.USD](United States Dollars)](https://www.hotcars.com/most-expensive-cars-in-jay-lenos-car-collection/).

That's the big one. Now for some of the smaller ones, in no particular order.

I appreciate the advice from [The Money Guy Show](https://www.moneyguy.com) when they say owning a home a long-term consideration. If you're not looking to be there for at least five years, it may be better to have the flexibility afforded by renting housing and not owning. I tend to move every 2 or 3 years. Sometimes it's just from one city to another.

I don't like tinkering or maintenance. Generally speaking, I don't modify the places the I live in; rarely even painting the walls (or hanging things on them to be honest). So, restrictions in this regard don't typically affect my happiness or experience in a place. I've also never had a landlord deny me the request to do something. Some maintenance falls into the total cost of ownership conversation for another time but to hit on it briefly, if the washing machine needs replaced, I don't typically pay for that. New toilets? Not me. Dishwasher goes out? Not it. Exterior needs painting? Not me either. Some people enjoy theses things, I'm not one of them.

This one might be a bit more controversial; I like being or knowing who owns the thing I'm using. Ultimately, the federal, state, and local governments own the homes we live in. If you don't pay property taxes, the house will be taken from you. If you don't pay the fees of the Home Owner's Association (if there is one), bad things can happen, up to and including being removed from the community (sounds like eviction from a rental). If you don't pay the mortgage, the bank will cease the house. I can definitively say I own my cellular phone; I can't do that with larger assets like a home or car. With renting an apartment or home I know the landlord. I delegate a lot of responsibility to them so I don't have to think about it or spend my time doing it.
