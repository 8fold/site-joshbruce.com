# February 15th, 2022 paycheck

{!! dateblock !!}

{!! data !!}

Reduced 401k allocation to 16 percent.

Part of my finance spreadsheet is for tracking 401k contributions. 

I put in the maximum contribution allowed, the estimated number of paychecks remaining for the year, and how much has been contributed. This way I know ahead of time if I should increase or decrease my allocation. The goal is to always have the allocation percentage to be:

1. high enough to receive full employer match (6 percent in this case) and
2. low enough to not hit the maximum contribution limit by the end of the year (maximize employer match as I don’t have a true-up provision).



## FI experiments

Details are in the [January 15th, 2022 paycheck](https://joshbruce.com/finances/building-wealth-paycheck-to-paycheck/20220115/#fi-experiments).

The hypothesis is when the Mark 0.0 mix is down, it‘ll be down more than the others. Further, when the Mark 0.0 is up, the others will be up and not too far behind the Mark 0.0. We will track the change since the previous paycheck as well as the change since we started tracking January 2022.
