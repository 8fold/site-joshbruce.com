## Saving isn't investing

The biggest difference between saving and investing, as I've taken to using the terms, is that saving involves currency while investing involves conversion to something else.

Cash is a liquid asset. It seems that the way we deal with people holding cash is to create more of it. By creating more of it, we typically cause inflation. This is similar to when a company [dilutes its stock](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/06/dilutivestock.asp) by issuing more in response to there being a concentration in the hands of one or more investors. In a way, currency is a share in something, usually a community of some sort, which would include nation-states.

With that said, a house is also an asset and would be considered a relatively illiquid asset. You take cash and convert it into holding the house. Generally speaking, it would be strange to convert the house directly into another asset, specifically cash. In some cases it could take months if not years. The time it takes to convert the asset back into cash is why it would be considered relatively illiquid as assets go.

The only way to lose money from an investment is to sell the asset for less than you purchased it for.

This bares repeating:

> The only way to lose money from an investment is to sell the asset for less than you purchased it for.

Technically I can also look at it a different way. The moment I purchased the asset, I've "lost" the money because it's no longer cash. From that point forward, the question is: What is the fair market value of the asset? If the fair market value is more than I paid for it, I haven't made money—unless I sell it for the higher amount (converting it to cash). If the fair market value is less than I paid for it, I haven't lost money—unless I sell it for the lower amount.

Finally, just because I use cash to purchase an asset doesn't mean I've made an investment.

## Investing, speculating, and gambling aren't the same



## Glossary

Fair market value
:    The amount you can expect to receive when converting an asset into cash through the sale of that asset.

Gambling
:    You trade currency to participate in an activity or for an asset with a high probability of losing money. (Compare to saving, investing, and speculating.)

Hedge fund
:    A privately available mutual fund.

Index
:    A method of tracking the performance of a group of assets in a standardized way.

Index fund
:    A mutual fund intended to follow a benchmark index of assets. *The Dow Jones Industrial Average is an index and there are mutual funds that try and match its performance; those mutual funds are index funds.*

Investing
:    You trade currency for an asset that historically increases in value over time with the intent of exchanging it for more currency than you paid at a later time. (Compare to saving, speculating, and gambling.)

Management (active)
:    A style of asset management whereby an individual or team of individuals actively choose assets to buy and sell and when; often with the intent of beating the returns of a benchmark index.

Management (passive)
:    A style of asset management whereby an individual or team of individuals choose assets to buy and sell based on a standardized methodology; often an index.

Mutual fund
:    A collection of assets held in trust; usually represented as shares using pooled resources of the shareholders and available to the public. *Mutual fund shareholders are not direct owners of the assets being purchased and do not have voting privileges.*

Saving
:    You receive income in the form of currency and hold it.
:    You spend less on an item than you normally would. *The "normally would" being the operative phrase. Purchasing something on sale that you would not have purchased is a bit different.* (Compare to investing, speculating, and gambling.)

Share
:    See stock

Speculating
:    You trade currency for an asset that you *believe* will be worth more at a later time, however, the outcome is highly uncertain. (Compare to saving, investing, and gambling.)

Stock
:    An asset held to represent partial ownership of an enterprise. *All private and public companies have stocks; regardless of participation in a stock exchange. Further, stock ownership often comes with the responsibility and privilege of voting on certain decisions made by the company.*
