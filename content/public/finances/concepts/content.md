# Concepts and definitions

{!! dateblock !!}

There's a somewhat morbid (I prefer the term practical or pragmatic) reason behind a lot of what I write on this site. It's not about teaching others per se or showing off things I know. Nah. It's a way to help myself and others should something happen to my brain-bits. 

So, in a way, these are letters to a future version of myself who maybe had an accident or no longer thinks the way I'm currently thinking and understanding things.

## Saving isn't investing

The biggest difference between saving and investing, as I've taken to using the terms, is that saving involves currency while investing involves conversion to something else.

Cash is a liquid asset and can typically be traded directly for goods and services. It seems that the way we deal with people hording cash is to create more of it. By creating more of it, we typically cause inflation. This is similar to when a company [dilutes its stock](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/06/dilutivestock.asp) by issuing more in response to there being a concentration in the hands of one or more investors. In a way, currency is a share in something, usually a community of some sort, which would include nation-states.

With that said, a house is also an asset and would be considered a relatively illiquid asset. You take cash and convert it into holding the house. Generally speaking, it would be strange to convert the house directly into another asset, specifically cash. In some cases it could take months if not years. The time it takes to convert the asset back into cash is why it would be considered relatively illiquid as assets go.

The only way to lose money from an investment is to sell the asset for less than you purchased it for.

This bares repeating:

> The only way to lose money from an investment is to sell the asset for less than you purchased it for.

Technically I can also look at it a different way. The moment I purchased the asset, I've "lost" the money because it's no longer cash. From that point forward, the question is: What is the fair market value of the asset? If the fair market value is more than I paid for it, I haven't made money—unless I sell it for the higher amount (converting it to cash). If the fair market value is less than I paid for it, I haven't lost money—unless I sell it for the lower amount.

Finally, just because I use cash to purchase an asset doesn't mean I've made an investment.

## Investing, speculating, and gambling aren't the same

I think it will be easier and more direct to take these in reverse order compared to the heading.

I go to a casino (or a [Chuck E. Cheese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_E._Cheese)). I trade my cash for tokens or chips. I use those tokens or chips to participate in various games. As I play I win and lose tokens. If I win tokens, the value of the asset I purchased (my pool of tokens) has gone up. If I lose tokens, the value of the asset I purchased has gone down. At the end of my time playing, I can exchange the tokens for cash. The majority of people lose money; that's what makes it gambling.

In the case of carnival-like systems, such as Chuck E. Cheese, it's pretty clever. I trade a dollar for [four metal tokens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_E._Cheese#Video_arcade) that can only be spent at Chuck E. Cheese; metal feels more expensive than paper. I spend those to play [skee-ball](https://www.skeeball.com). As I play, I earn paper tickets (feel less expensive than the tokens). Further, I often receive a higher quantity of the paper tickets compared to the number of tokens used to play the game in the first place; I'm getting more, so to speak. Then I can trade those paper tickets in for a toy of some kind, which is usually worth less than the amount of actual cash it took for me to play the game. Gambling (or, in this case, most of us would probably just consider this spending money not expecting a higher return on the investment; unlike the casino).  

Speculating is similar to gambling only the probability of a positive return on the cash spend is higher but still highly uncertain. Cryptocurrencies, for example, as of this writing could be considered speculative. The speculative nature comes in part because they are highly volatile when it comes to fair market value, they're a newer technological implementation of the [old guard concepts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/community_currencies.asp) (like community currencies, casino chips, Chuck E. Cheese, and, yes, government-backed currencies), and the regulations for them specifically and the services that have emerged to support them haven't been nailed down. Further, the primary way to increase profit compared to the cash spend is based on someone else in the future being willing to pay more than you paid. 

Investing is similar to speculating only the probability of a positive return on the cash spend is higher than either speculating or gambling. It's not to say it's guaranteed just that history demonstrates a positive return is probable.

## Net worth isn't the same as cash on hand

As of today, I'm part of the six-figure club, which is to say I have a net worth of roughly 100,000 [.United States Dollars](USD); this doesn't mean I have that in liquid cash. When we say someone is a millionaire or billionaire it's because, if we liquidated their assets, they would, in theory, have that much cash. However, if we liquidated their assets, eventually the fair market value of the assets would drop. 

The United States government can't tax the same dollar twice. So, as of right now and my understanding, if I put 100 USD of after-tax money into a savings account and that 100 USD earns 10 USD in dividends, I could get taxed on the 10 USD but not the 100 USD which was already taxed. 

Further, if I take that same 100 USD and buy shares in a mutual fund or a stock, I can't be taxed on that 100 USD (cost basis). If that stock generates dividends, the dividends could be taxed. If the fair market value of the stock goes up to 110 USD and I sell the the stock, I can be taxed on the capital gain of 10 USD…but not the original 100 USD. If I don't sell the stock, I don't get taxed on it. Stocks aren't taxed in the same way other hard assets are; like houses, cars, and so on.

I'm still looking for non-partisan primary sources and, given the rules of the game, this seems reasonable. The majority (over 80 percent) of taxes collected by the federal government are collected from individuals, not corporations (not speculating why). 97 percent of taxes paid comes from 50 percent of tax payers. There are two ways to pay 0 taxes:

- have a taxable income of 0 USD or
- have acquired less than a certain in long-term capital gains.

(Taxes in the United States are freaking weird.)

Gross income and taxable income aren't the same thing. Let's say you work somewhere and earn less than or equal to 12,500 USD in 2021 and you are filing your taxes a single person. Your taxable income is 0 USD because of the standard deduction everyone gets to take. Let's say you earned 32,000 USD and you contributed the full amount of 19,500 USD to your 401k, you're taxable income would be at 0 as well. Let's say you earned 35,600 USD you maxed out the 401k and maxed out an [.Health Savings Account](HSA) contribution for the year; taxable income of roughly 0. (Check out [this calculator](https://www.taxact.com/tools/tax-bracket-calculator).)

Now, let's say you threw 100 USD of after-tax money into the aforementioned stock then sold it 10 months later for 110 USD. The 100 USD wouldn't have tax implication, but the 10 USD would. Further, because the capital gains were less than 12 months old, it would count toward your total regular income as opposed to falling under the long-term capital gains rules.

Federal long-term capital gains rules basically have [their own graduated tax](https://www.fool.com/research/capital-gains-tax-rates/). If it's less than 40,000 USD or so, you pay 0 percent in tax. Similar to the regular tax bracket if you do all the saving ever.

Basically, looking at it from an ethical social engineering perspective, the federal government is trying to incentivize long-term saving and investing through the tax code with things like tax deductions for putting cash into various savings vehicles, tax-free growth, and in the case of HSAs and the Roth Individual Retirement Account, tax-free withdrawals. Further, if you're living strictly on capital gains from various investments (retired), you can live a modest lifestyle without paying any taxes; the moment you go over that 40,000 USD point though, you pay 15% tax on the amount you went over. So, also disincentivizing extravagance.

And, let's say you purchased Stock A for 20,000 USD and Stock B for 20,000 USD. A year later Stock A is worth 70,000 USD and Stock B is worth 10,000 USD. Stock has a capital gain of 50,000 USD and Stock B has a capital loss of 10,000 USD. You sell both and get 80,000 USD. Based on Stock A alone, you'd owe 15 percent on 10,000 USD (9,999 USD really, but still). However, you should be able to take a tax deduction for the 10,000 USD capital loss from Stock B, which means you would pay 0 tax…depending on the type of account and presuming the initial 40,000 USD investment was done with post-tax money. Now the new 50,000 USD has been taxed and can't be taxed again, because the government can't tax the same dollar twice.

As of this writing, the government doesn't tax ownership of assets like stocks and bonds. This distinguishes them from assets like homes and automobiles.

## Being rich and looking rich aren't the same  

## Glossary

Bonds
:    A loan issued by a company or government whereby you purchase the bond with a promise of repayment with interest. *Bonds are different than shares because shares imply some form of ownership, while bonds do not.*

Capital gain
:    An increase in value of an asset compared to the cost basis.

Capital loss
:    A decrease in value of an asset compared to the cost basis.

Cost basis
:    The amount of money it took to acquire an asset.

Fair market value
:    The amount you can reasonably expect to receive when converting an asset into cash through the sale of that asset; usually based on recent sales of similar assets.

Gambling
:    You trade currency to participate in an activity or for an asset with a high probability of losing money. (Compare to saving, investing, and speculating.)

Hedge fund
:    A privately available mutual fund.

Index
:    A method of tracking the performance of a group of assets in a standardized way.

Index fund
:    A mutual fund intended to follow a benchmark index of assets. *The Dow Jones Industrial Average is an index and there are mutual funds that try and match its performance; those mutual funds are index funds.*

Investing
:    You trade currency for an asset that historically increases in value over time with the intent of exchanging it for more currency than you paid at a later time. (Compare to saving, speculating, and gambling.)

Management (active)
:    A style of asset management whereby an individual or team of individuals actively choose assets to buy and sell and when; often with the intent of beating the returns of a benchmark index.

Management (passive)
:    A style of asset management whereby an individual or team of individuals choose assets to buy and sell based on a standardized methodology; often an index.

Mutual fund
:    A collection of assets held in trust; usually represented as shares using pooled resources of the shareholders and available to the public. *Mutual fund shareholders are not direct owners of the assets being purchased and do not have voting privileges.*

Realized
:    Whether or not a capital gain or loss has occurred. *The point at which we can say money has been earned or lost.*

Unrealized
:    Whether or not a capital gain or loss *would* occur. *The point at which we can have an idea of the fair market value of an asset; an appraisal on a house, for example, establishes the unrealized gain or loss in value.*

Saving
:    You receive income in the form of currency and hold it.
:    You spend less on an item than you normally would. *The "normally would" being the operative phrase. Purchasing something on sale that you would not have purchased is a bit different.* (Compare to investing, speculating, and gambling.)

Share
:    See stock

Speculating
:    You trade currency for an asset that you *believe* will be worth more at a later time, however, the outcome is highly uncertain. (Compare to saving, investing, and gambling.)

Stock
:    An asset held to represent partial ownership of an enterprise. *All private and public companies have stocks; regardless of participation in a stock exchange. Further, stock ownership often comes with the responsibility and privilege of voting on certain decisions made by the company.*
