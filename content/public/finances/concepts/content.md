# Concepts and definitions

{!! dateblock !!}

There's a somewhat morbid (I prefer the term practical or pragmatic) reason behind a lot of what I write on this site. It's not about teaching others per se or showing off things I know. Nah. It's a way to help myself and others should something happen to my brain-bits. 

So, in a way, these are letters to a future version of myself who maybe had an accident or no longer thinks the way I'm currently thinking and understanding things.

## Saving isn't investing

The biggest difference between saving and investing, as I've taken to using the terms, is that saving involves currency while investing involves conversion to something else. Arguably, investing is a style of saving.

Cash is a liquid asset traded directly for goods and services. 

In the case of the [.United States Dollar](USD), the Federal Reserve is the only sanctioned entity that can create or destroy cash. Because cash doesn't typically expire (like foodstuffs), it can tend toward being hoarded. To combat the hoarding tendencies we tend to print more of it; this is similar to company [dilutes its stock](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/06/dilutivestock.asp) by issuing more to combat concentrations of stock ownership (and voting power) by a few individuals. Printing more cash (or issuing more stock) tends to reduce the value of the cash, which causes prices to rise; inflation.

In a way, we can look at cash and other currencies as being a share of a community. In the case of the USD, it's a share in the United States economy and government, for example.

With that said, a house is a relatively illiquid asset. You take cash to purchase the home. Typically we don't trade houses for products and services, they must be sold (liquidated to cash). The time it takes to convert can be weeks, months, or, in some cases, years.

The only way to lose money from an investment is to sell the asset for less than you purchased it for. (Beware the sunk cost fallacy.)

This bears repeating:

> The only way to lose money from an investment is to sell the asset for less than you purchased it for.

Holding something in the hopes the value will go up again is different than continuing to pay for or purchase more of something that is declining in value with no appearances of increasing in value or return on investment.

Looked at in a different way, the moment I purchase an asset (convert cash to something else), I've "lost" the money because it's no longer cash. From that point forward, the question is: What is the fair market value of the asset? If the fair market value is more than I paid, I haven't made money, I have an unrealized gain. If I sell the thing at the higher value point, I've raised capital (a realized gain). If the fair market value is less than I paid for it, I haven't lost money, I have an unrealized loss. If I sell it for the lower amount, I've lost capital (a realized loss). At all other points, the asset is just increasing or decreasing in fair market value.

Finally, just because I use cash to purchase something doesn't mean I've made an investment.

## Investing, speculating, and gambling aren't the same

I think it'll be easier and more direct to take these in reverse order compared to the heading.

I go to a casino (or a [Chuck E. Cheese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_E._Cheese)). I trade cash for tokens or chips. I use those tokens or chips to participate in various games. As I play I win and lose tokens. If I win more tokens than I started with, the value of the asset I purchased (my pool of tokens) has gone up. If I lose tokens, the value of the asset I purchased has gone down. At the end of my time playing, I can exchange the tokens for cash. The majority of people who go to the casino leave with less cash; that's what makes it gambling.

In the case of carnival-like systems, such as Chuck E. Cheese, it's pretty clever. I trade a dollar for [4 metal tokens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_E._Cheese#Video_arcade) that can only be spent at Chuck E. Cheese; metal feels more expensive than paper and I traded 1 thing for 4 things. I spend the tokens to play [skee-ball](https://www.skeeball.com). As I play, I earn paper tickets (feel less expensive than the tokens), however, I often receive a higher quantity of paper tickets compared to the number of tokens used to play the game (1 token and I get 8 tickets); I'm getting more. Then I can trade those paper tickets in for a toy of some kind, which is usually worth less than the amount of cash it took for me to play the game. Further, I'm often left with 1 or 2 tickets, tokens, or both that can't be converted directly to cash and might cause me to purchase more tokens to 0 out. The activity and contrast of the trades makes it feel like I'm winning though and the concept of sunk cost can entice me to continue playing and losing monetary value in the exchange; it's gambling.

In the case of carnivals we'd most likely call it spending money and not gambling because we're usually not hoping for nor expecting a higher value return compared to the cash put in, which is different than how many feel about going to the casino or playing the lottery.

Speculating is similar to gambling only the probability of a positive return on the cash spent is higher though highly uncertain. 

Cryptocurrencies, for example, as of this writing could be considered speculative. The speculative nature comes in part because they are:

1. highly volatile when it comes to fair market value, 
2. a newer technological implementation of the [same old concepts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/community_currencies.asp) (like community currencies, casino chips, Chuck E. Cheese, and, yes, government-backed currencies), and 
3. the regulations for them and the service industry that's emerged to support cryptocurrencies are also in flux. 

Further, the primary way to increase profit compared to the cash spent is based solely on someone else in the future being willing to pay more than you paid. 

Investing is similar to speculating only the probability of a positive return on the cash spent is higher than either speculating or gambling and, at least in terms of stocks and bonds, dividends are paid fairly regularly. It's not to say it's guaranteed that you will receive dividends or the value will increase just that we have a long history demonstrating a positive return; in the case of the New York Stock Exchange in the United States, that history is about 100 years.

## Net worth isn't the same as cash on hand

As of this writing, I'm part of the six-figure club, which is to say I have a net worth greater than 100,000 USD and less than 1 million USD; this doesn't mean I have that in cash. When we say someone is a millionaire or billionaire it's because, if we liquidated their assets and paid off their liabilities, they would, in theory, have that much cash. However, if we liquidated their assets, eventually the fair market value of the assets would most likely drop in value (scarcity model and mindset). 

The United States government can't tax the same dollar twice. So, as of right now and my understanding, if I put 100 USD of after-tax money into a savings account and that 100 USD earns 10 USD in dividends, I could get taxed on the 10 USD but not the 100 USD which was already taxed. Only realized gains or losses have potential tax implications; not money that has already been taxed.

I'm still looking for non-partisan primary sources for the following and, given the rules of the game, this seems reasonable. The majority (over 80 percent) of taxes collected by the federal government are collected from individuals, not corporations (not speculating why). 97 percent of taxes paid comes from 50 percent of tax payers. 40 percent of taxes are paid by the top 1 percent of earners (those earning over 500,000 USD per year in taxable income). (Again, haven't found primary sources that didn't include some form of slant or misrepresentation of those numbers.)

There are two ways to pay 0 taxes:

- have a taxable income of 0 USD or
- have acquired less than a certain amount in long-term capital gains.

(Taxes in the United States are weird; I think I understand how we got here from a gaming perspective, but still.)

Gross income and taxable income aren't the same thing. 

Let's say you work somewhere and earn less than or equal to 12,500 USD in 2021 and you are filing your taxes as a single person. Your taxable income is 0 USD because of the standard deduction everyone gets to take. 

Let's say you earned 32,000 USD and you contributed the full amount of 19,500 USD to your 401k (in 2021), you're taxable income should be 0; the 12,500 USD standard deduction and the 19,500 USD to a retirement plan that lowers your adjusted gross income. 

Let's say you earned 35,600 USD you maxed out the 401k and maxed out a [.Health Savings Account](HSA) contribution for the year; taxable income of roughly 0. (Check out [this calculator](https://www.taxact.com/tools/tax-bracket-calculator).)

Now, let's say you threw 100 USD of after-tax money into the aforementioned stock then sold it 10 months later for 110 USD. The 100 USD wouldn't be taxed, but the 10 USD would count as regular, taxable income. 

Federal long-term capital gains rules have [their own progressive tax](https://www.fool.com/research/capital-gains-tax-rates/). 

Let's say you invested 60,000 after-tax USD, a few years later it's now worth 100,000 USD. If you sell for the whole 100,000 USD the 60,000 USD doesn't have any tax implications because it's already been taxed. The 40,000 USD in gains is also not taxed because the current long-term capital gains progressive tax is 0 percent on up to 40,000 USD. You now have 100,000 USD and have paid 0 taxes on it. Granted, you had to have earned 60,000 and invested it, then waited long enough for it to increase in value by 40,000 USD; paid for patience.

Basically, looking at it from an ethical social engineering perspective, the federal government is trying to incentivize long-term saving and investing through the tax code with tax deductions, tax-free growth, and in the case of HSAs and the Roth Individual Retirement Account, tax-free withdrawals. Further, if you're living strictly on capital gains from various investments (retired), you can live a modest lifestyle without paying any taxes; the moment you go over that 40,000 USD point though, you pay 15% tax on the amount you went over. So, also disincentivizing extravagant living.

One more thing: Net worth has nothing to do with actual worth as a human. To be more accurate it's just financial net worth. If all assets were liquidated and all liabilities were paid off, the difference is financial net worth.

## Accumulation, drawdown, and rebalancing

Finances can be divided into two primary modes:

1. accumulation and
2. drawdown.

When in accumulation mode, you receive most revenue from an outside source; employment, sales, and similar. (Someone else’s assets become yours.) When in drawdown, you're giving your assets to someone else or otherwise liquidating them. It's less a light-switch and more a spectrum. 

In accumulation mode, you want to purchase assets that are less valuable per unit now. In drawdown, you want to sell assets that have increased in value compared to the overall portfolio.

Being able to shift strategies between purchasing low and selling high is one reason for having more than one type of security; this is *not* the same as diversification. 

For example, I'm currently operating a variation on what is sometimes called the VTSAX and chill approach. In short, this approach asks us to increase income while reducing expenses and investing the difference in a total stock market index fund (specifically [VTSAX](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/VTSAX)) and just hold on for the ride. As the cost per share of the index fund goes up, we are constantly buying in at the higher price; thereby, increasing our average cost basis. When the cost per share goes down, we are buying low. In no case are we selling or divesting to something else. For me, I'm using two index funds to allow me to divest a bit without selling.

One index fund is a total stock market index fund and is distributed based on market capitalization, favoring larger companies; larger companies get a higher percentage of each invested dollar. The other index fund is also based on market capitalization and favors companies with smaller market capitalizations. This means one of the index funds may have a lower fair market value than the other and I can contribute to the one with the lower fair market value instead of continuing to push money into the companies with higher price per share.

Purchasing this way isn't, strictly speaking, rebalancing because I'm not selling one security consuming a high percentage of value in the portfolio to purchase another that's consuming a low percentage of value in the portfolio. Instead, I'm bring money from the outside and putting it into the portfolio.

When I shift to drawdown, I'll do the opposite; selling the higher percentage of overall value in the portfolio and taking it in the form of cash.

For example, the targets I've established for my portfolio is to have roughly 33 percent in small-, mid-, and large-cap United States stocks. Let's say my portfolio has 100 USD in it. 25 USD in small-cap, 25 USD in mid-cap, and 50 USD in large-cap. 

1. If I was in accumulation mode and had 100 USD to put in, I'd purchase 42 USD in small- and mid-cap while purchasing around 16 USD in large-cap, which would result in roughly 66 USD being in all three. 
2. If I were in drawdown mode and needed 50 USD, I would sell 34 USD from the large-cap and 8 USD from the small- and mid-cap portions, which would put the portfolio back into balance. 
3. If I were rebalancing the portfolio, I'd sell 16 USD from the large-cap and put 8 USD toward the other two.

Purchase based on what's low and sell based on what's high using target percentages not the total of gains, losses, or cost basis. While gains, losses, and cost basis might be worth considering, it'd be more for fine-tuning as the macro-allocation and moves would have the greatest impact and the others would be micro-optimizations.

Index funds are internally rebalanced regularly, however, these internal rebalancing events don't impact your cost basis (or gains and losses) much. You're not buying the stocks, bonds, or other securities; you are buying shares of the fund and the fund manager is buying the stocks, bonds, or other securities based on the details of the fund ([VTSAX](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/portfolio/vtsax), for example).

## Cost basis, capital gains (or losses), and methods

You buy 100 shares of an index fund for 1 USD each (lot 1); 100 USD on day one. On day two you buy another 100 shares of the same index fund for 2 USD each (lot 2); 200 USD. Your total cost basis is 300 USD and you have 200 shares valued at 2 USD each. On day three the fair market value of a single share is 3 USD, which means the value of your investment is 600 USD; 200 shares at 3 USD each. 

300 USD is your cost basis and 300 USD is an unrealized capital gain, which is spread across two lots. (If the fair market value was 200 USD, the 100 USD difference between the value and your cost basis is an unrealized capital loss.)

Let's say you want to sell 60 USD worth of shares at 3 USD each; 20 of your 200 shares (10 percent). The transaction can be performed using various [methods](https://investor.vanguard.com/taxes/cost-basis/methods) (the link is for Vanguard; other brokerage firms should allow similar methods):

1. average cost;
2. first in, first out;
3. highest in, first out; and
4. lot [.identifier](ID) (or specific ID).

I don't understand average cost enough yet, so, we'll skip it for now. Mainly, I'm not sure the implications when it comes to capital gains and losses except what is noted in the link; in limited circumstances, capital gains or losses may be converted to short-term instead of long-term.

First in, first out sells the oldest shares purchased first. This increases the possibility that the sale will fall under long-term capital gain and loss rules. It also means, there's a chance, there will be more capital gains compared to the cost basis of those shares compared to younger shares.

Highest in, first out sells the shares based on the price paid, not the date of purchase and will sell the more expensive ones first. As a result, this method should take better advantage of both capital gain and loss, however, (as stated in the link) in limited cases short-term capital gains or losses may be realized before long-term.

Lot ID means you get to look at each lot and shares you've purchased and choose which to sell. This offers the most flexibility, requires the most work, and carries the most risk should undesired results occur. With this method, you may decide to sell a bunch of shares in something that had a lot of capital gains along with something else that had some capital losses to possibly reduce the overall tax footprint.

In general, I'd say we don't want dividends automatically reinvesting except if there's only one security at play (VTSAX and chill), or, the account in question is a tax-advantaged account; where rebalancing and dividends won't be a taxable event. Instead, have the dividends kick out into the settlement account, then purchase back into whatever makes the most sense and only after reducing the amount to cover taxes for those dividends.

## Bulls, bears, and corrections

Most days, the United States stock market is, well, just the stock market. With that said, there are certain events that have been given names. It's important to note that, from what I understand, there's a difference between events happening in or to "the market" and events happening to folks in general, however, the two may experience good and bad at the same time.

A bull market means fair market values of things are tending to increase roughly 20 percent in a two month stretch; a bear market is the opposite. A correction is a decrease of 10 percent in a short period of time. A crash is a decrease of 40 percent or more.

So, from highest to lowest the market goes like this:

1. bull (20 percent up),
2. stable,
3. correction (10 percent down),
4. bear (20 percent down),
5. crash (40 percent or more).

Since 1900 corrections have occurred [about once a year](https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2013/11/difference-crash-correction/) and last about 4 months. Bear markets have happened roughly every 3.5 years and last roughly one year. Crashes have happened roughly once every 12 years, not sure how long they last because there seems to be some debate on how many have occurred (at least in the United States). When I talk about how long they each last, what I'm referring to is the time it took before the overall market being considered to return to it's previous highest point; this is different than when values start to rise again in general. 

Corrections are typically short-term events, as the name implies, once the market has corrected we should be in a roughly stable state. Historically the stable state for the New York Stock Exchange is roughly an 8 percent increase year over year. 

I'll try to be explicit in saying the New York Stock Exchange because "the stock market" is a misnomer, because not all stocks available for purchase are in the New York Stock Exchange. There are roughly 4,000 companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange and there are literally millions of businesses registered in the United States, all of which have at least one stock or share. This is also why I try to avoid using the term "the market" as well, because "the market" is vast and the New York Stock Exchange represents a small fraction; diverse as it might be, you have to be a certain type of business to even be listed there (no judgment on the businesses that are listed).

A recession and depression are not necessarily related to the stock market in general. Instead these are terms for how businesses and employment are functioning. Granted if business begins to shrink and employment does the same, chances are people won't be pumping money into the stock market.

With that said, these are factors when considering risk tolerance and risk capacity.

## Risk tolerance and risk capacity

I have a high risk tolerance, which is to say, I'm pretty comfortable taking risks in general.

I have a high risk capacity. I'm pretty confident my job and income will continue for at least another year. I have an emergency fund capable of carrying me for a little bit. My employer will cash out saved vacation time. I'm not planning on entering drawdown for a decade or so and feel in good health; the Great Depression in the United States took 30 years to recover to the previous high, which matches with the oldest dollar I'll have invested.

As time moves on, things may change. I know, specifically, as I get closer to shifting to drawdown on the younger funds, I'll start shifting toward the Mark 1 portfolio; as long as there's not a literal paradigm shift that renders that course obsolete—not likely, but still.

## Being rich and looking rich aren't the same  

A couple more interesting sets of figures I plan to consider further regarding sources and accuracy.

The first set has to do with those with a net worth of a million USD or more. Roughly 80 percent of millionaires are considered first generation, which is to say they didn’t inherit a million USD. Further, 60 percent of them didn’t inherit more than 100,000 USD. Finally, a majority (over 50 percent) didn’t reach a net worth of a million USD until after age 50 and most of their net worth was inside an employer-sponsored retirement plan (like a 401k) and their home.

The second set of figures has to do with generational wealth; what I’ve heard called the wealth wash cycle. 50 percent of inherited wealth will be lost by the second generation and 90 percent will be lost by the third generation. I’m not sure if this includes inheritance to multiple parties. What if 10 million USD is divided amongst 10 siblings; one million each? Does this dataset mean 5 million USD will be lost by the second generation, that 5 of the siblings will lose all of their inheritance, or does it include both. (It’s worth noting that this isn’t to say generational wealth doesn’t exist or that something like trickle down economics works at a scale large enough to matter.)

There’s a sort of template phrasing that goes like this:

> X rich, Y poor.

**Life rich, cash (or retirement) poor:** Is the most generic and sometimes used as shorthand to describe someone whose lifestyle gives the appearance of having a lot of money, however, when viewed from a per paycheck basis (or accounting for liabilities), they don’t have a lot of cash flow or discretionary funds. This could be traveling, owning expensive assets like cars, something else, or a combination. “They must be rich,” might be a response made by onlookers.

**House (or car) rich, cash (or retirement) poor:** Similar to the previous only this time it’s a particular type of asset. Having a one million USD home or car that accounts for the majority (or all) of their financial net worth.

There are plenty more of these turns of phrase, the point being that in one aspect the person looks rich, while in another aspect the person appears poor. 

Another item of note is how somewhat common being a millionaire is in the United States. [Yahoo! Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/millionaires-america-2020-50-states-201203665.html) references research from Phoenix Marketing International stating there are over 8 million households who can claim millionaire status. With that said, most of them are unknown to us. We usually only hear about those who are more lavish or loud about it. While this is only a little over 2 percent of the overall population of the United States, the population of the United States includes all individuals, including children, not households or groups.

## Glossary

Asset allocation
:    The proportion of each asset class within a portfolio.

Bonds
:    A loan issued by a company or government whereby you purchase the bond with a promise of repayment with interest. *Bonds are different than shares because shares imply some form of ownership, while bonds do not.*

Capital gain
:    An increase in value of an asset compared to the cost basis.

Capital loss
:    A decrease in value of an asset compared to the cost basis.

Correction
:    A decrease 

Cost basis
:    The amount of money it took to acquire an asset.

Diversification
:    Holding multiple assets wherein some assets may increase in value while others decrease in value at different degrees or direction. *One asset may increase while the other decreases or vice versa, or, one asset will rise or fall in fair market value faster or slower than another.*

Expense ratio
:    The ongoing cost for managing a mutual fund. *The percent is a per year number, however, the percent is usually divided by roughly 365 to generate a Daily percent, which is charged daily.*

Fair market value
:    The amount you can reasonably expect to receive when converting an asset into cash through the sale of that asset; usually based on recent sales of similar assets.

Gambling
:    You trade currency to participate in an activity or for an asset with a high probability of losing money. *In some cases this may feel like purchasing a product, like a car, which we don't tend to view as gambling in the way we would purchasing a lottery ticket.* (Compare to saving, investing, and speculating.)

Hedge fund
:    A privately available mutual fund.

Index
:    A method of tracking the performance of a group of assets in a standardized way.

Index fund
:    A mutual fund intended to follow a benchmark index of assets. *The Dow Jones Industrial Average is an index and there are mutual funds that try and match its performance; those mutual funds are index funds.*

Investing
:    Purchasing a security that produces some form of income and historically increases in fair market value. *A home you live in would not necessarily qualify, however, a house where you collect rent would.* (Compare to saving, speculating, and gambling.)

Liquidity
:    How easily a given security can be traded for products and services in a given context.

Lot
:    A pool of assets (ex. Stocks) purchased at the same time and at the same cost basis.

Management (active)
:    A style of asset management whereby an individual or team of individuals actively choose assets to buy and sell and when; often with the intent of beating the returns of a benchmark index.

Management (passive)
:    A style of asset management whereby an individual or team of individuals choose assets to buy and sell based on a standardized methodology; often an index.

Market (capitalization)
:    The estimated value of a company based on multiplying shares outstanding and price per share.

Market (correction)
:   A correction occurs when the overall value of assets in a broad-based collection of assets drop by 10 percent.

Market (bear)
:    A bear market occurs when the overall value of assets in a broad-based collection of assets drops by 20 percent or more.

Market (bull)
:    A bull market is when the overall value of assets in a broad-based collection of assets increases by 20 percent or more; usually in a two month period.

Mutual fund
:    A collection of assets held in trust; usually represented as shares using pooled resources of the shareholders and available to the public. *Mutual fund shareholders are not direct owners of the assets being purchased and do not have voting privileges.*

Net worth
:    The amount remaining after adding together the fair market value of all assets and subtracting the fair market value of all liabilities.

Realized
:    Whether or not a capital gain or loss has occurred. *The point at which we can say money has been earned or lost.*

Rebalancing
:    The act of selling an asset with higher fair market value than other assets and using the funds from that sale to purchase assets with the lower fair market value to bring the percentages of all assets back to their targets.

Risk capacity
:    How much risk you "must" take on to reach your financial goals.
:    How long you're able to continue on when things go pear-shaped. *You may have a high risk tolerance but not be able to survive if things go pear-shaped.*

Risk tolerance
:    How much uncertainty you're willing to take on.

Saving
:    You receive income in the form of currency and hold it.
:    You spend less on an item than you normally would. *The "normally would" being the operative phrase. Purchasing something on sale that you would not have purchased is a bit different.* (Compare to investing, speculating, and gambling.)

Share
:    See stock

Speculating
:    You participate in an activity or purchase a product that does not generate income on its own, however, you believe it will increase in value in the future and you can sell it for a profit compared to the total cost you paid. *Buying a home you do not collect rent from would most likely fall under this heading.* (Compare to saving, investing, and gambling.)

Stock
:    An asset held to represent partial ownership of an enterprise. *All private and public companies have stocks; regardless of participation in a stock exchange. Further, stock ownership often comes with the responsibility and privilege of voting on certain decisions made by the company.*

Sunk cost fallacy
:    The idea that a company or organization is more likely to continue with a project if they have already invested a lot of money, time, or effort in it, even when continuing is not the best thing to do. *Throwing good money after bad.*

Tax location
:    The type of account in which various securities are held and how they are treated for tax purposes.

Unrealized
:    Whether or not a capital gain or loss *would* occur. *The point at which we can have an idea of the fair market value of an asset; an appraisal on a house, for example, establishes the unrealized gain or loss in value.*
