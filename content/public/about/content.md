# About me

I'm not very good at talking about myself without prompting. So, I'll most likely be revisiting this one a few times as I figure out "the voice" it'll have.

The alphabet soup:

- [.PSM](Professional Scrum Master) I, II, and III; in some cases multiple times
- [.PSPO](Professional Scrum Product Owner) I
- [.PSD](Professional Scrum Developer) I
- [.SPS](Scaled Professional Scrum)
- ICAgile Certified Professional - Agile Coaching
- ICAgile Certified Professional - Agile Team Facilitation
- [.BFA](Bachelor of Fine Arts) with a focus in studio arts

## Principles

1. Never enter anything without an exit strategy.
