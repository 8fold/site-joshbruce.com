# About me

I'm not very good at talking about myself without prompting. So, I'll most likely be revisiting this one a few times as I figure out "the voice" it'll have.

The alphabet soup:

- [.PSM](Professional Scrum Master) I, II, and III; in some cases multiple times
- [.PSPO](Professional Scrum Product Owner) I
- [.PSD](Professional Scrum Developer) I
- [.SPS](Scaled Professional Scrum)
- ICAgile Certified Professional - Agile Coaching
- ICAgile Certified Professional - Agile Team Facilitation
- [.BFA](Bachelor of Fine Arts) with a focus in studio arts

## Values

1. Autonomy: When I do the [Motivators exercise](/design-your-life/motivators/) on myself, the ability to “choose my own adventure” ranks second; every time.
2. My values and principles over social norms and mores.
3. Intellectual legacy over
    - financial legacy over
    - genetic legacy.

## Principles

1. Never enter anything without an exit strategy.
2. There's no such thing as intrinsic value, only perceived value.
3. Scarcity alone doesn't make something more valuable.

## Practices

4. Think win-win and meeting in the middle.
10. Don’t bet on others to fail.
3. Maximize the number of people supporting your progress.

In times of stress, I can come back to these and center myself from a time when I was in a more stable place mentally, emotionally, and financially.
