# Web references and resources

A curated list of references and resources for developing on the web.

I consider the following as canonical in nature because they are created and maintained by a recognized officiating body for web standards; specifically, the [.w3c](World-Wide Web Consortium):

- [HTML living standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org)
- [Web content accessibiity guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/) tool
- [WAI-ARIA overview](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/) from the w3c's [.WAI](Web Accessibility Initiative) [.ARIA](Accessibile Rich Internet Applications).
