I tend to favor publishing ebooks, which may be updated on occasion; buy once, keep forever.

I'm still working through how this works for audiobook versions; how much like an ebook are they?

Stephen Covey described four generations of time (and possibly life) management. I see a fifth enveloping the first four; in the same way successive generations enveloped the ones before. The fifth generation solidifies and firmly plants the concepts of flow, agility, purpose, and by extension, mindfulness into self-management.

*Triumph over Time* helps usher in the fifth generation without emphasizing a specific approach or vantage, which is in keeping with the fifth generation itself.
