# Design your life

{!!dateblock!!}

This is one of those "when I was a kid" stories, fair warning; I'll try to be brief.

When I was 15 and for the rest of secondary school, my house was a gap hearing spot for my friends. We got together pretty much every day and even called those get together days gatherings. Mostly we just wanted a place we felt safe to be ourselves.

Most of the time we played games and shot the shit.

It was sometimes difficult convincing some of my friend’s parents there wasn’t anything more happening. They couldn't believe their kids would want to come to my house all the time unless there was sex, drugs, and rock-and-roll along with speed, weed, and birth-control—going on. Funny part was I had three rules in my house:

1. No alcohol.
2. No drugs.
3. No sex.

Those were my rules, not my dad's. Basically, the only thing my friends were allowed to do at my house that they couldn't do at theirs was curse and smoke cigarettes; many of them didn't even smoke.

On the days when we weren't playing games and just chatting we’d discuss existential issues. I know, 15, right? How deep could they have been really?

To which I’ll turn to [David Bowie](https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/davidbowie/changes.html) in response:

> And these children that you spit on
>
> As they try to change their worlds
>
> Are immune to your consultations
>
> They're quite aware of what they're going through

And, if you're not into that one, consider that [Sophie Scholl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie_Scholl) of the White Rose was 21 when she was executed for high treason against the Nazi Party; her brother was 25.

In fact, ageism was often a topic of discussion at my house gatherings.

Anyhoo.

Something I started telling my friends was I wanted to help them become the highest version of themselves, based on their definition. It wasn’t what I wanted them to be. I also wanted them to help me grow and consider what a great version of myself would look like.

It’d be a long time later before realizing it wasn't a Josh Bruce original. It would be even longer before I found I was able to essentially make a living at it.

While I focus on helping people make peace with time and space it's really about helping you design your life. That's what this area of content is about.
