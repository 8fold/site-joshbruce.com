# Van life

{!! dateblock !!}

Around 1995 I started thinking about what I called The RV Dream. I spent a lot of time designing interiors and a roof capable of generating electricity and collecting rain water.

In 2010 I had my first introduction by way of becoming homeless and living in my car. 

In 2011 and 2012 I started thinking a boat might be just as interesting. I designed a trimaran and considered paying for a course in a designing boats.

Now, I’m 2022, here I am again and a lot has changed both in me and in the world of lifestyles beyond the traditional.

I’m not going to muddy the waters here by talking about historical thoughts and ideas. 

Everyone has their own journey and route. For me, I want something fitting to my lifestyle.

Things I enjoy:

1. travel,
2. space, and
3. long showers.

Those last two aren’t really what comes to mind when talking about any sort of portable living situation. The first is the one I see cited often from full-timers.

I’m not looking for a house inside a vehicle. This idea of a house that happens to be in a vehicle is what I see a lot in builds; different people, different journeys.

Wood cabinets. Tile backsplashes and sometimes showers. Different zones that can be used simultaneously. That sorta thing. That’s not what I’m going for as I consider what’s right for me. Instead, I’m looking at modes.

Generally speaking, I don’t find myself in multiple modes at the same time. I’m not showering, sleeping, and eating at the same time, for example. Therefore, if I look at this housing change through that lens, the ability to quickly and efficiently change modes within the vehicle increases flexibility.

The modes identified:

1. traveling,
2. sleeping,
3. working,
4. eating (includes cooking),
5. bathing,
6. restroom (urinating and defecating),
7. dressing, and
8. entertaining (self and others).

Thinking each mode will be given a section of this page, a standalone page, or both. Given [my profession](/coaching/) at the moment, thinking I’ll start with the [MoSCoW method](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method), while used as a prioritization technique, I’m using it primarily to distinguish between a minimally viable product and a more desirable one.

## Traveling

### Must have

1. Roughly 20 [.miles per gallon](mpg) unladen.
2. At least 1 full-size spare tire.

### Should have

1. Electric engine.

## Sleeping 

Sleeping mode happens roughly once per day for about 8 hours. During this time most other modes are unnecessary.

### Must have

1. Sleep one comfortably.
2. A way to easily switch to restroom mode.

### Should have

1. Sleep two comfortably; full XL.

### Could have

1. Queen sized mattress.
