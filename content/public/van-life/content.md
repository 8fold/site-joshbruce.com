# Van life

{!! dateblock !!}

Around 1995 I started thinking about what I called The RV Dream. I spent a lot of time designing interiors and a roof capable of generating electricity and collecting rain water.

In 2010 I had my first introduction by way of becoming homeless and living in my car. 

In 2011 and 2012 I started thinking a boat might be just as interesting. I designed a trimaran and considered paying for a course in a designing boats.

Now, I’m 2022, here I am again and a lot has changed both in me and in the world of lifestyles beyond the traditional.

I’m not going to muddy the waters here by talking about historical thoughts and ideas. 

Everyone has their own journey and route. For me, I want something fitting to my lifestyle.

Things I enjoy:

1. travel,
2. space, and
3. long showers.

Those last two aren’t really what comes to mind when talking about any sort of portable living situation. The first is the one I see cited often from full-timers.

I’m not looking for a house inside a vehicle. This idea of a house that happens to be in a vehicle is what I see a lot in builds; different people, different journeys.

Wood cabinets. Tile backsplashes and sometimes showers. Different zones that can be used simultaneously. That sorta thing. That’s not what I’m going for as I consider what’s right for me. Instead, I’m looking at modes.

Generally speaking, I don’t find myself in multiple modes at the same time. I’m not showering, sleeping, and eating at the same time, for example. Therefore, if I look at this housing change through that lens, the ability to quickly and efficiently change modes within the vehicle increases flexibility.

The modes identified:

1. traveling,
2. sleeping,
3. working,
4. eating (includes cooking),
5. bathing,
6. restroom (urinating and defecating),
7. dressing, and
8. entertaining (self and others).

Thinking each mode will be given a section of this page, a standalone page, or both. Given [my profession](/coaching/) at the moment, thinking I’ll start with the [MoSCoW method](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method), while used as a prioritization technique, I’m using it primarily to distinguish between a minimally viable product and a more desirable one.

## Traveling

### Must have

1. Roughly 20 [.miles per gallon](mpg) unladen.
2. At least 1 full-size spare tire.

### Should have

1. Electric engine.

## Sleeping 

Sleeping mode happens roughly once per day for about 8 hours. During this time most other modes are unnecessary.

### Must have

1. Sleep one comfortably.
2. A way to easily switch to restroom mode.

### Should have

1. Sleep two comfortably; full XL.

### Could have

1. Queen sized mattress.

## Working

Much like sleep mode, work mode happens roughly once per day and lasts roughly 8 hours. With that said, having easy access to other modes is more desirable and, given how awesome the twenty-first century is, this mode is very flexible.

For example, I’m writing this on my phone while preparing to go full sleep mode in the apartment. I also just did a release of the site for the [March first, 2022 paycheck](/finances/building-wealth-paycheck-to-paycheck/20220301/), which was updated and released using my phone; from writing and updating the spreadsheets to submitting and committing the pull request to deploying to my host.

I love the twenty-first century for the most part.

If I decide to go back to an office situation, it’s also roughly 8 hours where I won’t even be in or near the vehicle. With that said, I’ll presume a working remote situation as I also do side gigs, artwork, and writing.

### Must have

1. An accommodating work surface that can comfortably fit a laptop and possibly paperwork.

### Should have

1. The ability to stand while working that is ergonomic in its nature.

## Eating

Here’s where it gets interesting.

When it comes to food, I’m pretty utilitarian. Some people live to eat and I eat to live. I rarely cook for friends and family. I use salt and rarely any other spices or additions. All told, I spend about 3 hours per day cooking and eating.

I’ve been streamlining my food intake for about two decades.

Breakfast 6 days a week consists of half a pound of sausage, 3 eggs, and 10 ounces of vegetables (a fifty-fifty split between carrots and broccoli). Supper 6 days a week consists of roughly half a pound of chicken and 10 ounces of vegetables; broccoli and carrots. Lunch 7 days a week consists of a smoothie; frozen mixed berries, honey, ice, water, creatine, collagen, and sometimes chia seeds. While drinking the smoothie I usually take a broad spectrum multivitamin and a fish oil pill and snack on some form of chocolate candy. (I typically do a pseudo-fast day during which I only gave the smoothie.)

I’ve found this gives me enough caloric intake to feel energized throughout the day. The fiber content keeps me fairly regular. My body doesn’t do well with spices, so, the lack helps reduce inflammation, gas, and bloating. The range of macro- and micro-nutrients is also helpful.

Enough about that though. 

I use the cookware and utensils for all of it. And, when it comes to power consumption and special tools, this is probably the most intense mode.

I usually carry 1 week’s worth of groceries at any given time. The state needs to be flexible enough to increase if necessary, which will most likely be more dry goods (see 2020 pandemic).

### Must have

I’m going to leave this blank for now because I’m trying to be relatively strict in the definition of must.

### Should have

1. A flat surface large enough for a cooktop, scale, blender, and bowl.
2. A cooktop; preferably induction.
3. A 10–12 inch frying pan.
4. A bowl.
5. A fork and knife.
6. A spatula.
7. A package of lard.
7. A blender; Nutribullet or similar.
8. Measuring cup.
9. Scale; battery operated.
10. Refrigerator large enough to hold 3 1 pound sausage packages, 2 dozen eggs, 64 ounces of broccoli (or broccolini), 64 ounces of carrots, and a little extra.
11. Freezer large enough to hold 8 chicken thighs, 3 bags of frozen fruit, 12 ice cubes, and a little extra.
12. A sink, bowl, or both for washing dishes.
13. A fresh water tank, hookup, or both.

## Bathing

I love showers. I never thought I’d be able to handle life without them. Then I became homeless and my world shifted dramatically on the difference between want and need. I’ve decided I need a way to brush my teeth every day and would like to be able to shower at least once a month (increased if I do heavy activities or the like).

### Must have

1. A sink, bowl, or both to brush teeth.
2. A fresh water tank, hookup, or both.
3. A way to take showers regularly; at least once every two weeks.
4. A way to rinse and sanitize underarms, genitals, and anal region.
5. A fresh water tank, hookup, or both.

### Should have

1. A shower near by.

### Could have

1. A shower; recirculating.
2. A way to choose continuous flow or on-demand water flow.
