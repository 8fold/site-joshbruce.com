Open source doesn't necessarily mean open license. Along that same line, free as in beer isn't the same as [free as in speech](https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/31717/what-do-the-phrases-free-speech-vs.-free-beer-really-mean/).

## Naming conventions

The `.` (dot, period) is reserved for filenames and should not be used in folder names.

The `_` (underscore) at the beginning of a file or folder name represents a draft.

## Redirection

Sometimes content will need to be moved from one location to another. We don't want this to negatively impact users.Further, we want to stick to our policy of letting the server be a server; therefore, redirection is handled in the `.htaccess` file found in the `public` folder.

TODO: We are working toward automating the build of this portion of the `.htaccess` file; pardon the bumps as there may be a request for you to modify your submission to facilitate.
