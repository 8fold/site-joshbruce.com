Welcome to the rabbit-hole.

My name is Josh Bruce (shocker); I don't play rugby—do a search—the failings of not having an internet-unique name. With that said, I'm fascinated by human thought ([memetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memetics)), the human experience, and how we interact with each other and those thoughts and ideas.

The site is divided into the following areas:

1. [My books](/books/) are books I've written or am in the (sometimes extended) process of writing; I'm driven by feedback and pull (demand).
2. [Essays and editorials](/essays-and-editorials/) are my consolidated thoughts on various topics.
3. [Examinations and summaries](/examinations/) is where I review and reflect on the media which helps inform my consolidated thoughts.
4. [Experiences](/experiences/) is where I talk about applying the consolidated thoughts.

I'm a multifaceted being, just like you, and this site covers my whole and authentic [self](/experiences/the-self/).

So, sit back, relax, and get lost for a while with me.
