# Procrastinate on Purpose by Rory Vaden

A super short summary is available as a [TEDx talk](https://youtu.be/y2X7c9TUQJ8).

There is no such thing as time management, only self-management. Time and urgency gives us the tool of prioritization, what Vaden refers to as two-dimensional thinking. The limit of prioritizing things doesn't do anything to create more time and does nothing to help you accomplish the other items on the todo list.

Priority dilution: The more the highly efficient gets done, the more things they are tasked with, eventually leading to burnout.
