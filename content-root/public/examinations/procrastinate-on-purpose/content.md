# Procrastinate on Purpose by Rory Vaden

Also available as a [TEDx talk](https://youtu.be/y2X7c9TUQJ8).

There is no such thing as time management, only self-management (see also [The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People](/examinations/the-7-habits-of-highly-effective-people/)). Time and urgency gives us the tool of prioritization, what Vaden refers to as two-dimensional thinking. The limit of prioritizing things doesn't do anything to create more time and does nothing to help you accomplish the other items on the todo list.
