# Procrastinate on Purpose by Rory Vaden

A super short summary is available as a [TEDx Talk](https://youtu.be/y2X7c9TUQJ8).

There is no such thing as time management, only self-management. Time and urgency gives us the tool of prioritization, what Vaden refers to as two-dimensional thinking. The limit of prioritizing things doesn't do anything to create more time and does nothing to help you accomplish the other items on the todo list.

Priority dilution: The more the highly efficient gets done, the more things they are tasked with, eventually leading to burnout.

You are not too busy. You have the same amount of time as Martin Luther King Junior, Mahatma Ghandi, and Mother Theresa. Your life is your responsibility. 

You are not a victim. You are in charge. You are capable. You are powerful enough to decide what you will and won't do with your time.

Shift focus toward getting things done rather than worrying about the fact you have to do them.
