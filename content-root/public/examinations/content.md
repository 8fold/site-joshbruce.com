# Examinations and summaries

I value diversification of thought a great. In pursuit of this value, I expose myself to a lot of different and disparate content. This area of the site is where I practice empathy.

The goal of each article is not to inject my own ideas but to represent the ideas of others. While it's impossible to leave myself out completely, unlike the [essays and editorials](/essays-and-editorials/) the goal isn't to put my interpretations on display.

At the same time, this will be a curated examination and not a catch-all for *everything* I've exposed myself to.
