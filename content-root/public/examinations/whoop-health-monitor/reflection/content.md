# Reflecting on the Whoop, health monitor

{!! dateblock !!}

I was introduced to the Whoop via my adventure partner, Becca. I trust her judgment as she's more active than I am and is [ACE-certified](https://www.acefitness.org).

I don't like jewelry or jewelry-like things, but my [health and wellness](/experiences/health-and-wellness/) concerns escalated in 2023, and I'm willing to put the inconvenience aside.

When introducing new things, I try to keep my routine the same, and introducing the Whoop was no exception; I want to make decisions based on insights and reflections.

As I'm wont to do, I'm looking for the practices that deliver the most significant value across the greatest breadth. As of this writing, that means sleep and recovery.

## The mobile app

As of this writing, I customized the overview section of the application to show everything the Whoop can summarize:

1. Average heart rate,
2. respiratory rate,
3. [.HRV](Heart Rate Variability),
4. [.RHR](Resting Heart Rate),
5. sleep needed,
6. sleep performance,
7. hour of sleep,
8. restorative sleep,
9. time in bed, and
10. calories.

I have average heart rate and respiratory rate flagged to show at the top, where you can have 4 key statistics displayed; you can only pick 2, as strain and recovery are always shown.

## The web app

The mobile app syncs regularly with the [Whoop web app](https://app.whoop.com/) and offers a much broader view than is possible on a mobile device.

The charts and graphs could be helpful to someone who is a little more into data and analytics than I am. But I might start delving deeper.

## Recharging

After the first 4 days, I've devised a recharging strategy.

I don't like bringing too many electronics into my world because I often forget to recharge them, or the batteries die at inconvenient times. If I can't create a more self-maintaining flow, I walk away.

For the Whoop, I've decided to wear it until it drains to about 20 percent. Then, while taking a shower (I don't wear it in the shower even though I could), I'll recharge it using the block.

The block carries about one-and-a-half charges.

So, the system ends up looking something like this:

1. Device is 20 percent charged.
2. Charge the device while in the shower.
3. When the device is 90 percent charged or more, stop charging the device, and start charging the block.

This way, a full charge should always be available in the block when needed. Further, I only need to charge the Whoop every 3 or 4 days.
