# Reflecting on the WHOOP, health monitor

{!! dateblock !!}

I was introduced to the WHOOP via my adventure partner, Becca. I trust her judgment as she's more active than I am and is [ACE-certified](https://www.acefitness.org).

I don't like jewelry or jewelry-like things, but my [health and wellness](/experiences/health-and-wellness/) concerns escalated in 2023, and I'm willing to put the inconvenience aside.

When introducing new things, I try to keep my routine the same, and introducing the WHOOP was no exception; I want to make decisions based on insights and reflections.

As I'm wont to do, I'm looking for the practices that deliver the most significant value across the greatest breadth. As of this writing, that means sleep and recovery.

## The mobile app

As of this writing, I customized the overview section of the application to show everything the Whoop can summarize:

1. Average heart rate,
2. respiratory rate,
3. [.HRV](Heart Rate Variability),
4. [.RHR](Resting Heart Rate),
5. sleep needed,
6. sleep performance,
7. hour of sleep,
8. restorative sleep,
9. time in bed, and
10. calories.

I have average heart rate and respiratory rate flagged to show at the top, where you can have 4 key statistics displayed; you can only pick 2, as strain and recovery are always shown.

## The web app

The mobile app syncs regularly with the [WHOOP web app](https://app.whoop.com/) and offers a much broader view than is possible on a mobile device.

The charts and graphs could be helpful to someone who is a little more into data and analytics than I am. But I might start delving deeper.

## Recharging

After the first 4 days, I've devised a recharging strategy.

I don't like bringing too many electronics into my world because I often forget to recharge them, or the batteries die at inconvenient times. If I can't create a more self-maintaining flow, I walk away.

For the WHOOP, I've decided to wear it until it drains to about 30 percent. Then, while taking a shower (I don't wear it in the shower even though I could), I'll recharge it using the block.

The block carries about one-and-a-half charges.

So, the system ends up looking something like this:

1. Device is 30 percent charged.
2. Charge the device while in the shower.
3. When the device is 90 percent charged or more, stop charging the device, and start charging the block.

This way, a full charge should always be available in the block when needed. Further, I only need to charge the Whoop every 3 or 4 days.

I’ve started cleaning the part of the device that comes in contact with my skin at least every time I charge it. I’ve also started switching which wrist it’s on after each charge.

After a while of wearing it on my right wrist I noticed two things. The first was that I kept ripping arm hairs out from the clasp (more on that later). The second was that the skin in that area would become sensitive and sore.

At first I thought the band was too tight and loosened it a bit, this did seem to help. But, eventually, a pustulate formed and popped. It was bad. Noticeable from a few feet away and irritated. I switched to using the left wrist for a while to let the right side heal a bit. A similar itching and sensitivity sensation started on the left side as well. I applied a salve to the right side in the hopes it would heal quickly; specifically, before the same thing happened on the left side. 

Anyway, things seem to be better now. There’s still some deformation of the skin under the device. And the right side is still a little worse for wear. But I shouldn’t end up with a noticeable tan line, which is cool.

Now for changing how I put the device one. Instead of positioning it where I want it to be clasping it down, I do it upside down. Let me explain.

I feed my hand through the band. I place the device against my underarm right at the base of my palm. I clasp the band. There’s less hair and the band is looser. Then I spin the whole setup around so the device on the top part of my and slide it into position roughly an inch from the landmark wrist bone.

So far this combination seems to be helping.
