# WHOOP, health monitor

{!! dateblock !!}

[WHOOP](https://www.whoop.com) is a health monitoring device.

You can use [my referral link](https://join.whoop.com/C55FFC) to receive:

1. a new (not refurbished) device, and
2. get a one-month credit against your chosen package, as long it's not the promotional package offered by Whoop).

When you use the referral link, I get a one-month credit for my account.

The device is what I'll call an extension device with a battery, sensors, and minimal storage. The "magic" happens when synced with an application installed on another device via [Bluetooth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth). The device will continuously feed data to the application when in range and can [store multiple days' worth of data](https://support.whoop.com/s/article/How-much-data-is-stored-on-my-WHOOP-4-0) when out of Bluetooth range. Presumably, this helps keep the device small.

I'm not going through what all Whoop can track because it's a pretty extensive list, and they provide [a lot of content to help](https://support.whoop.com/s/).

## The first 4 days

The device takes 4 days for initial calibration.

During the first 4 days, the data isn't trustworthy. The Whoop doesn't have preconceived notions or targets. It's effectively a blank slate.

You may notice it showed high strain or stress when you don't believe you're experiencing either. That's because it's basing it on your historical data.

Following the first 4 days, Whoop will continue monitoring and recalibrating based on the historical data. 

## The first 30 days

It's recommended to have at least 30 days of data before considering the device and application insights to be personalized; good thing you can generally get one month free.

As of this writing, I have not had the device for 30 days and can't speak much more on the topic.

## Recharging

Recharging the device is interesting, in a good way.

My presumption is it's designed to keep the device's size minimal and improve or maintain the waterproof nature of the device. Further, it allows you to recharge the device without removing it.

You directly charge the recharging block using the provided cable. Then you slide the block onto the device, which will start recharging wirelessly from the block.

## Unboxing

The delivery box was standard cardboard with bubble wrap to protect the other device box.

The box the WHOOP came in is a matte black with a perforated strip for easy access. Unfortunately, it broke apart when I first tried pulling. They could add a strip of cardstock or something along the strip to reduce the possibility of breakage.

Opening the two flaps reveals the recharging block and the setup instructions; well done. Pulling out the instructions reveals the Whoop device with the strap attached. There is a tab that says, "Lift." 

Pulling the tab brings the device out of the box; well done again. Once the device is out of the box, you lift the same tab [to release the wristband clasp](https://youtu.be/hBa-QQi5Cqc), revealing the Whoop itself; well done again, as it discretely teaches you how to open the wristband. The fabric portion of the wristband is looped on one end to allow you to adjust the wristband to your wrist. The other side of the fabric is secured to the clasp and holder. 

Follow the instructions, and you should be good. 

Beneath the device is the recharging cable. The recharging cable is USB-C on one end and USB-A on the other.
