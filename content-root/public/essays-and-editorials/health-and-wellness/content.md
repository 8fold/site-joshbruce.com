## Breathing

This may be a departure from what you’ll find if you search for these terms. So, as is our way here, we’re looking more at the concepts than specific implementations.

We’ll identify 3 models for breathing sequences, and then settle on 1, all encompassing model. The 3 models are linear, triangle, and box. 

Linear breathing is made of inhaling and exhaling. Go ahead and inhale for a count of 4, then immediately start exhaling for a count of 4.

Triangle breathing is made of inhaling, exhaling, and a hold. The hold may occur either before or after the inhale. Holding a full inhale or exhale. Go ahead and inhale for a count of 4, then hold for a count of 4, then exhale for a count of 4, then repeat. Now try holding the exhale. Inhale for a count of 4, exhale for a count of 4, hold for a count of 4, then repeat. 

Box breathing is made of inhaling, holding (with descended diaphragm), exhaling, and holding (with ascended diaphragm). Go ahead and inhale for a count of 4, hold for a count of 4, exhale for a count of 4, then hold for a count of 4, then repeat.

The all encompassing model is box breathing.

Box breathing is all encompassing because we can change the counts to whatever we want. If one of the holds is a 0 count, we have triangle breathing. If both holds are a 0 count, we have linear breathing.
















Let’s explore this.

Inhale for 4 you-seconds, then exhale for 4 you-seconds—repeat; that’s linear breathing. Now try inhaling for 4, holding for 4, and exhaling for 4—repeat; that’s triangle breathing (it’s worth noting that the hold could also be after the exhale). Now try inhaling for 4, holding for 4, exhaling for 4, and holding for 4—repeat; that’s box breathing.

The universal model is box breathing. For example, the previous paragraph could have been written as follows.

Inhale for 4, hold for 0, exhale for 4, hold for 0—repeat; that’s box breathing and results in what we would also call linear breathing. Now try inhaling for 4, holding for 4, exhaling for 4, and holding for 0—repeat; that’s triangle breathing and results in what we’d also call triangle breathing. Now try inhaling for 4, holding for 4, exhaling for 4, and holding for 4—repeat; that’s box breathing.

Most of us have two options to bring air in and out, the nose and the mouth. It’s been said that the nose is for breathing and the mouth is for exercising (or eating), but it kind of depends on what activity you’re performing. Consider exercising the soft palette.

For most of us, the tongue and soft palate dictate whether we are breathing through the nose or mouth. 

Try this, relax your jaw and open your mouth a bit; we’re not at the dentist here. You should be able to inhale and exhale through your mouth. Now try a 4 count breathing sequence inhaling through your nose and exhaling through your mouth. And just keep doing this. 

Pay attention to what’s happening at the back of your throat. Is your tongue moving up and down, is the soft palate, or both? The preference would be that only the soft palate moves while the tongue is resting in a bottom neutral position.

Good times, and a good exercise for the soft palate.

The main drawback to breathing this way is that your mouth will dry out. It can be easily resolved by closing the mouth and moving saliva around, taking a sip of water, or both.

That’s the mouth bits, now let’s talk about the torso bits.
