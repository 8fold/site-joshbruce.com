# Innovation and invention 

The difference between innovation and invention is that invention is creating something that has never existed before (or at least Iâ€™d non-obvious) while innovation is taking aspects of other things and combining them a new, original way.

The arguments here are that invention is impossible and everything is innovation. Or, the opposite end, everything is invention despite the idea of innovation.

The original iPhone was an innovation combining and iPod, internet browser, and cellular phone. (Arguably there were other components folded into the iPhone, but these three were the marketing language.)
