# Net worth and portfolios

{!! dateblock !!}

Not sure why this has been playing in my head recently, but here we are. I will start from the broad concepts and work down to the details. I will use contract-like language in the sense that defined terms will be capitalized throughout this article.

Assets are things you have that could be converted into cash (also known as liquidating). Liabilities are things you have that oblige you to repay. Net Worth is the result of taking the sum of the value of all your assets and subtracting the sum of the value of all your Liabilities.

Standard bookkeeping.

When discussing Portfolios, we typically speak only about Assets, our Asset Portfolio. As I've been learning more about finances, I've included Liabilities when I talk about my Portfolio. I've done so partly because I don't want to change what's included in my Net Worth calculations. By having both Assets and Liabilities be part of my Portfolio, I can give each Targets and Bands for each in my Portfolio. Further, if I were to use Liabilities to purchase one or more Assets, I get feedback from the portfolio.

Suppose I add the total of my Liabilities (as a positive number) to the total value of my Assets; this gives me the total value of the Portfolio. In that case, I can use it as the denominator to calculate the percentage each occupies in my Portfolio. Total Liabilities divided by the Portfolio's total (positive) value gives us the percentage Liabilities occupy. Total Assets divided by the Portfolio's total (positive) value gives us the percentage our Assets occupy.

For example, let's say I have 40,000 USD of value in a retirement account and another 5,000 USD in cash; I have a total of 45,000 USD in Assets. Now, let's say I have a car loan of 5,000 [.United States Dollars](USD) and a student loan of 50,000 USD; I have a total of 55,000 USD in Liabilities. From here, we can get 3 different numbers:

1. Net Worth: `45,000 - 55,000 = -10,000`
2. Assets as a percent: `45,000 / (45,000 + 55,000) = 0.45 (or 45 percent)`
3. Liabilities as a percent: `55,000 / (45,000 + 55,000) = 0.55 (or 55 percent)`

If my Net Worth is negative, I know my Liabilities are outpacing my Assets without any further calculations. That's one of the things that makes Net Worth powerful from a feedback perspective. With that said, these three numbers combined form an informational foundation to set goals (Targets) and make changes.

A Target is the ideal percentage of the portfolio for a given segment. A Band is a deviation from the Target we're okay with.

Generally speaking, we want Liabilities to occupy a smaller percentage than our Assets, thereby resulting in a positive Net Worth. If someone came along and wanted to call in our debt (Liabilities), we might still have money left over after selling our Assets.

In investing terms, we would say "margin" for taking on a Liability to purchase some Asset. We would say "margin call" when the person or organization who gave us the money demanded it back.

My ideal (Target) for Liabilities is 0 percent. Therefore, my ideal (Target) for Assets is 100 percent. With that said, I like to eat, have a place to live, and so on, all of which either are Liabilities in themselves or have Liabilities associated with them through their [total cost of ownership](/essays-and-editorials/finances/total-cost-of-ownership/).

0 percent Liabilities is impossible to maintain day-to-day. Therefore, I want to set bands for myself. I find it easiest to start where you are. Let's go back to the example of the person with 45 percent Assets and 55 percent Liabilities. This isn't about judgment and criticism; it's meeting ourselves where we are so we can move to where we want to be.

In terms of Bands, I typically set 4. There's a maximum, a high, a low, and a minimum. For this person, maybe they start with:

- maximum 55 percent,
- high of 50 percent,
- a Target of 45, 
- low of 40, and
- minimum of 35.

The next step is to see if I can get my actual percentage to match the Target. When it does, maybe I move the Target down a bit, keeping the same distance from the Target for the Bands, like the following:

- Maximum 50 percent,
- high of 45 percent,
- a new Target of 40, 
- low of 35, and
- minimum of 30.

In this sense, the Target and Bands become the [guideline and guardrails](/essays-and-editorials/guidelines-and-guardrails/), respectively.

Because Assets aren't typically correlated with one another, we could say we have a diversified Portfolio.

Let's break Assets and Liabilities down into segments as well.

## Breaking down Assets

I've come to recognize 4 segments of Assets:

1. Liquid: 
	1. These are Assets that are easily exchanged for products, services, and repaying Liabilities. 
	2. These Assets typically have a real rate of return less than inflation; the quantity and quality of products and services you can purchase diminish over time.
	3. They may have a holding period of up to 1 year.
2. Growth: 
	1. These are Assets that aren't easily exchanged for products, services, and repaying Liabilities. 
	2. These Assets have a historical real rate of return greater than inflation; that's why we call them Growth Assets. 
	3. We're not talking about growth in terms of style boxes for equities, which are a specific type of Growth Asset.
	4. The value of these Assets tends to fluctuate day-to-day. However, over the course of decades, their value tends to increase.
3. Negative Correlation: 
	1. These are Assets that aren't easily exchanged for products, services, and repaying Liabilities.
	2. The historical real rate of return for these Assets is less important than their value.
	3. The value of these Assets tends to fluctuate less day-to-day than Growth Assets, and the value or income generated tends to increase when the value of Growth Assets decreases.
	4. These Assets also tend to have a low or negative correlation with Liquid Assets.
4. Low Correlation:
	1. These are Assets that aren't easily exchanged for products, services, and repaying Liabilities.
	2. The value of these Assets may fluctuate daily compared to Growth Assets. However, they typically fluctuate for different reasons; this is what gives them a low correlation to Growth Assets specifically and all three of the others generally.

It's important to note and reiterate; we're not talking about specific types of Assets. We are talking about the characteristics of Assets. These four segments of Assets likely exist if an economy is at play.

Thinking back to old prison and war movies where cigarettes and matches could be traded for products and services. In that context, they were a Liquid Asset. In another context, they might be considered a Liability.

Further, if you are operating within an economy, you have a Portfolio consisting of Assets and Liabilities. Specifically Liquid Assets, like your time and labor.

When we talk about historical returns, in most cases, we're talking in terms of decades. I'll give some examples in the United States for each segment, as of this writing, based on the characteristic of the Asset:

1. Liquid: 
	1. The United States Dollar, also known as cash.
	2. [.Certificates of Deposit](CDs) or Share Certificates with a maturity date of one year or less.
	3. Government and Corporate Bonds with a one-year or less maturity date.
2. Growth: Shares in corporations, also known as equities.
3. Negative Correlation: Long-Term United States Treasury Bonds.
4. Low Correlation: Gold and other commodities.

I intentionally gave more for the Liquid Asset segment so I could say the following. There may come a time when these things change. The characteristics of Share Certificates, for example, may hit a point where their historical real rate of return and other characteristics causes them to move to Low Correlation instead of Liquid. The same could be said for gold, possibly moving to something more Liquid-like.

When I talk about the allocation of the Asset Portfolio, these are the segments I use. When I design systems, I look to have three qualities:

1. self-maintaining,
2. self-cleansing, and
3. the ability to opt-in to complexity.

For years my Asset Portfolio was completely Liquid. My Liabilities outweighed my Assets by a lot. If I did the calculations, I would have been 60 percent Liabilities and 40 percent Assets. And that 40 percent was all Liquid Assets. Then I started contributing to my employer's 401k plan. I was purchasing Growth Assets in the form of shares in indexed mutual funds, opting into more complexity. 

I set myself Targets and Bands for how much I wanted in Liquid Assets and how much I wanted in Growth Assets. In December 2020, my Liabilities hit 0 for the first time in almost 20 years, and I set the Target for Liabilities to 0 percent with a high Band of 0.5 percent and a maximum band of 1 percent. I may purchase something with a loan in the future, and the high and maximum Bands may change. But, for now, this works.

I also set Targets and Bands for Liquid and Growth in my Asset Portfolio. 

Returning to the self-maintaining concept, I set milestone events to change the allocation and increase complexity. When the Asset Portfolio hits a certain value, I'll add in Negative Correlation assets. The Portfolio is a ways off from that point. Therefore, I'm not committing myself to a specific Asset because I don't know what Assets will fall into that category when it hits that milestone. Still, I know what characteristics I'll look for when it does.
