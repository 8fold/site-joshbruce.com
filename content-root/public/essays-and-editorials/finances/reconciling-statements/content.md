# Reconciling statements

Investopedia haș a pretty good definition presented in their accounting article on [reconciliation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reconciliation.asp). While their article is geared toward business, the same is true for any legal entity, including a person.

As of this writing I use [Wave](https://www.waveapps.com) for my accounting and budgeting software. I really appreciate the experience for double-entry bookkeeping and reconciliation.

In double-entry bookkeeping there are always two entries in two different accounts. One subtracts money from the balance and the other adds money to a balance. Expense accounts, like "Food" don't have a running balance and typically don't need to be reconciliation. It's recommended that Asset accounts, like "Cash on hand," be reconciled regularly.

In short, reconciliation is comparing the entries from two different ledgers. The first is your ledger; what I keep in Wave. The second is the ledger for the institution (or custodian) of the account being reconciled; typically using a statement.

Different accounts and institutions have different intervals for the generation of these statements. These statements will typically have a starting balance and an ending balance; there is no standard across institutions—so, each statement starts as an exercise in learning where the information is and what it's called. 

The starting balance should match the ending balance for the previous period. The ending balance should match the balance you have in your ledger as of the same ending date. If either of these balance pairs don't match then there are transactions that are missing or that shouldn't be there, which launches us into a more in-depth form of reconciliation. If the statement starting and ending balance match yours, chances are you don't need to do anything further; the account has been reconciled. With that said, it's possible for the balances to match while the individual transactions don't.

For example, I was verifying my bank account with an institution that makes a micro-deposit and withdrawal to make sure they have the correct account information. This results in a deposit to my account and a withdrawal a day or two later; resulting in a 0 [.United States Dollar](USD) change in the account. When I reconciled I realized I had two deposits and two withdrawals when there was supposed to only be on. 

If you don't use any type of accounting software, or don't keep a ledger, then reconciliation may be an opportunity to look at the list of transactions on an account to verify you recognize them; the no math approach.

## Cash and credit card accounts

Between cash (and credit cards) and investments, I find cash to be easier to reconcile. Or, to put it a different way, these types of accounts feel more intuitive and straightforward.

I'm going to presume you use software or keep a ledger with a running balance.

Look at your statement. Most likely there is a place on the statement that starts with something like, "Starting" or "Prior" or "Previous" and ends with "as of" a date. There should also be a place on the statements that starts with something like, "Ending" or "New" or just "Balance." There might be other information that is not really going to help you when it comes to reconciliation as well.

In you ledger, go to the entry with the same date as the statement starting date, or the entry just before that date. Look at the running balance; it should match. Now go to the entry with the same date as the statement ending date, or the entry just before that date; the running balance in your ledger should match the balance on the statement. 

Accounting software should make this easier for you. In Wave, [for example](https://support.waveapps.com/hc/en-us/articles/208621636-How-to-use-Account-Reconciliation), I put in the ending date for the statement and the ending balance, if it matches the Wave voodoo happening in the background, I'm reconciled. If it doesn't match, I'm taken to a detailed view of the transactions in my ledger so I can figure out what I've missed.

## Investments

I was so frustrated trying to reconcile my investment accounts. I think I have it sorted though.

My initial frustration was that all of my contributions were being tracked as expenses, because they were going to other institutions. So, the first hurdle was ensuring I had all of my asset accounts listed in my [Chart of Accounts](https://support.waveapps.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004972106-Understanding-your-chart-of-accounts).

Next is the fact that investment accounts aren't cash and the value (or balance) fluctuates. I buy a share for 1 USD, it goes up in value by 50 percent, my ending "balance" (the value of the share) is 1.50 USD, but there are no transactions to account for those day-to-day fluctuations.

So, instead, we reconcile against cost basis or total cost; not the average of either of those things because that won't reconcile smoothly; I speak from experience.

Total cost includes:

1. Every purchase of the security.
2. Dividends that are earned and reinvested; there will typically be two entries in the statement for this, however, you may only wan to use one entry for your accounting. The first entry on the custodian's statement will be the dividends going into the [settlement ether (account)](https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/online-trading/settlement-fund) before being put back into the security.
3. Realized gains (usually only for mutual funds).
4. Realized losses(usually only for mutual funds).
5. Any administration fees outside the expense ratio of the fund; 401k and similar retirement accounts—check your statements and with the custodian of the account.

All of these should appear as transactions on the statement from the custodian and on your ledger.  

What's not included in total cost are the day-to-day values of the shares.

What made this so confusing for me was the number of transactions I saw on the statement for what, for me, were very simple transactions.

In my head there's two entries:

1. The withdrawal from my pass-through account at my credit union.
2. The purchase of shares in the security.

What I see on the statement is sometimes three or four entries for one complete transaction:

1. The withdrawal from my pass-through account.
2. The deposit to the custodian.
3. The purchase of the shares in the security.
4. A posting of the funds to a settlement account.

Not only that, but these entries use language like sweep in and sweep, which I don't know what that means. And when the numbers were off, it just made it difficult to actually reconcile and figure out what happened. 

Anyway, pretty overwhelming.

Use trade date, not settlement date for transactions.
