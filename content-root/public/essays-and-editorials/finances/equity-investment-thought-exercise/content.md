# Equity investment thought exercise

{!! dateblock !!}

René Descartes once said: I think, therefore, I am. This was part of a small text he wrote entitled *Meditations in First Philosophy*. In it he was pondering the existence of god (in a secular sense). He concluded that he existed because he had a mental idea of self; I think (of an “I”), therefore, I am (a thing that most likely exists). Further, turning that conclusion into a premise, he continued that because he could envision a being one might call god, god must exist. For our purposes though, this is more about how he started this exercise.

Where Descartes started was to raze everything he thought to be true to the ground. Or, as Yoda might say, to unlearn what he had learned. A naive approach. A beginner’s mind. And so on.

Over the last few days I’ve been considering this as it relates to mutual fund investing, specifically in equities, and even picking stocks, if so inclined.

## Three sizable people

You have 100 tokens you intend on trading with other people with a potential to earn dividends along with the hope of thing purchase increasing in value over time.

You are approached by three people:

1. has 10 tokens already,
2. has 20 tokens, and
3. has 70 tokens.

You can split your tokens in any manner you see fit, but you can’t learn more about the individuals.

I think many folks would say it’s impossible, because we want to know how they performed historically in giving dividends or having the value of their tokens increase. However, at the same time, we’ll agree that historical performance doesn’t guarantee future performance. In some cases we might even agree that recent success either indicates increased probability of lower future performance.

So, without having more information, how would you divide your tokens?
