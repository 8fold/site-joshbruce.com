# Equity investment thought exercise

{!! dateblock !!}

René Descartes once said: 

> I think, therefore, I am. 

This was part of a small text he wrote entitled *Meditations in First Philosophy*. In it he was pondering the existence of god (in a secular sense). He concluded that he existed because he had a mental idea of self; I think (of an “I”), therefore, I am (a thing that most likely exists). Further, turning that conclusion into a premise, he continued that because he could envision a being one might call god, god must exist. For our purposes though, this is more about how he started this exercise.

Where Descartes started was to raze everything he thought to be true to the ground. Or, as Yoda might say, to unlearn what he had learned. A naive approach. A beginner’s mind. And so on.

Over the last few days I’ve been considering this as it relates to mutual fund investing, specifically in equities, and even picking stocks, if so inclined.

## Three sizable people

You have 100 tokens you intend on trading with other people with a potential to earn dividends along with the hope of thing purchase increasing in value over time.

You are approached by three people:

1. has 10 tokens already,
2. has 20 tokens, and
3. has 70 tokens.

You can split your tokens in any manner you see fit, but you can’t learn more about the individuals.

I think many folks would say it’s impossible, because we want to know how they performed historically in giving dividends or having the value of their tokens increase. However, at the same time, we’ll agree that historical performance doesn’t guarantee future performance. In some cases we might even agree that recent success either indicates increased probability of lower future performance.

So, without having more information, how would you divide your tokens?

Maybe you believe that someone who has amassed 70 tokens must know how to allocate their resources, therefore, you’ll give all of your tokens to the person with 70 tokens. This is akin to purchasing an S&P 500 mutual fund with your 100 tokens.

This means the first person still has 10 and the second still has 20 while the third now has 170; the gap between the person with the least and the most has almost tripled—going from 60 to 160.

Maybe you want to go the opposite of the previous and give 100 tokens to the first person. This is akin to a total small market fund.

This means the first person now has 110 tokens, the send still has  20 tokens, and the third still has  70 tokens; the distance between the person with the least and most is 90.

Maybe you’re inclined to distribute the money to each of them based on how much they already have (any capitalization-weighted mutual fund), thereby, giving more to the person with the most while giving a little to everyone. This is akin a total stock market mutual fund; total stock market and chill.

This means the first person has 20 tokens, the second has 40, and the third has 140; everyone’s token count doubles and the gap between the one with the most and the one with the least goes from 50 to 120.

Maybe you think people who have money don’t need (or possibly deserve) more. So, you give 55 tokens to the first person, 40 tokens to the second person, and 5 to the third person. This is asking to an extended market fund.

This means the first person now has 65 tokens, the second person has 60 tokens, and the third person has 65 tokens as well; the gap between the person with the least and most went from 50 to 5, and two people now have the same amount.

Maybe giving the same amount to each person feels the most appropriate to you. You 34 tokens to the and 33 tokens to the other two. There are lots of ways to do this with mutual funds.

This means the first person now has 44 tokens, the second has 53 tokens, and the third person has 103. The gap between the one with the most and the one with the least goes from 50 to about 60.

What values, principles, and practices guide your choice?

No judgment. Nothing from me or the outside world saying, “You should do it this way.” What feels right to you and why?

This uses a quantitative approach to choosing. Next we’ll consider the more qualitative.

## Three motivated people

There’s going to be less walkthrough from here on out. 

You have 100 tokens you intend on trading with other people with a potential to earn dividends along with the hope of thing purchase increasing in value over time.

You are approached by three people:

1. is believed to be worth more than their current cost,
2. is somewhere between the first and third in their motivations, and
3. is believed to have greater future earnings.

How do you divide your tokens? How are you deciding?

Each of these people gave a certain number of tokens as well. For example, the United States market has shows that the first person has about 24 tokens, the second person has about 40 tokens, and the third person has about 36 tokens.

## 11 specialists 

You have 100 tokens you intend on trading with other people with a potential to earn dividends along with the hope of thing purchase increasing in value over time.

11 people walk up to you, each is a specialist in a given field (sector):

1. basic materials,
2. consumer cyclical,
3. financial services,
4. real estate,
5. consumer defensive,
6. healthcare,
7. utilities,
8. communication services,
9. energy,
10. industrials, and
11. technologies.

How do you want to divide things? Why?

Maybe you want to be distributed evenly. Maybe you want to avoid one as much as possible. Maybe you just want to make sure you don’t have more than a certain percent in any one of them.

## 4,000 individuals

There are roughly 4,000 equities available for purchase in the New York Stock Exchange. Each falls into the size question, the value-blend-growth question, and the sector question.

How do you decide? Do you even want to decide?

The farther down this exercise you go the more complexity and time may be involved.
