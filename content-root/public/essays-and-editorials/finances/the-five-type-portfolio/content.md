# Net worth and portfolios

{!! dateblock !!}

Assertions:

1. Everyone has a portfolio.
2. Every portfolio has 5 categories.
3. Each category can grow and shrink independently of the other categories.
4. Each type is based on characteristics, not the thing itself.
5. Things may move between types based on historical performance.

Let's use dessert as a metaphor.

We’ll have a plate, there's always a plate. We'll have at least one brownie, there's always one brownie. We may order another brownie. We can also add condiments such as whip cream, fruit compote, etc. Finally, we can add sprinkles like chocolate chips or similar.

The plate represents your liabilities and expenses, time or money you exchange with other people. Everyone gets a plate.

The first brownie is your short-term assets and income, the lifetime you have, or money you exchange with other people, usually on liabilities. Everyone has at least one brownie. For some people, the brownie might be small compared to the plate, their liabilities are greater than their short-term assets. For others, the brownie might be edge-to-edge and 4 times thicker than the plate. And all points in between.

The second brownie is what we call growth assets. Not everyone orders this brownie. For others, this brownie dwarfs the first brownie.

The condiments are negatively correlated assets. Compared to the second brownie (growth assets), things in this portion of the dessert tend to increase while growth assets decrease and vice versa. Not everyone has condiments. Other people are like that relative who takes a tiny sliver of pumpkin pie and adds two cups of whipped cream.

The sprinkles are assets with a low correlation to the other portions of the dessert. Again, some people really like sprinkles, possibly to the point of only having the first brownie and sprinkles. Other people avoid sprinkles entirely.

From a quantity perspective, you can have the same volume of stuff making up this dessert. However, when looking at the ratio, these components can shift. And they can shift for all sorts of reasons. 

Let’s go deeper.

We’ll give the general characteristics of each, some things that fall into each category as of this writing, and how categories get larger or smaller in volume without necessarily changing the number of things in it.

## The plate (liabilities and expenses)

Characteristics:

1. You give something you have to someone else once or regularly.
2. Historically, the real rate is often the most negative compared to the other components.
3. Interest rates are in terms of [.Annual Percentage Rate](APR) and indicate excess money given to someone else.

By “historically,” we’re talking in terms of decades; 10, 20, 30, 40, and so on years. We typically give more weight to recent data as things change and evolve over time. What was true 40 years ago may not be true now, and including data from 40 years ago can skew averages and medians.

When I say “real rate,” we take the APR and add the inflation rate.

Ingredients that go into making the plate:

1. Recurring bills: Utilities, rent, food, and similar purchases.
2. Terminal loans: Like a mortgage or car loan.
3. Revolving loans: Like credit cards and lines of credit.
4. Future replacement costs: A cellphone has a useful life of 2 to 5 years. A roof has a useful life of 15 to 20 years.

That's not an exhaustive list. And the key characteristic is that you can’t eat a plate. The ingredients making up the plate go to someone else.

There are 4 major things that can make the plate grow and shrink; 2 are most likely out of your control:

1. Inflation and deflation.
2. An emergency.
3. The [hedonic treadmill](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill) and lifestyle inflation.
4. The [Diderot Effect](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diderot_effect).

Inflation is the tendency for the same quantity of products and services to cost more over time; we're not discussing quality. This also goes back to the commentary on favoring recent data. Let’s look at the [.United States Bureau of Labor Statics](BLS) [.Consumer Price Index](https://www.bls.gov/charts/consumer-price-index/consumer-price-index-by-category-line-chart.htm) data. We’ll use the "all items" category for each month.

From February 2022 through January 2023 (12 months), the average inflation rate was: 7.9 percent. From February 2013 through January 2023 (120 months or 10 years), the average was: 2.5 percent. From February 2003 through January 2023 (20 years), the average was: 2.49 percent.

There were some deflation months in 2009. 2009 was during [The Great Recession](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession), and inflation averaged 3 to 4 percent the previous year.

Notice that inflation for the last year is almost triple the last 10 and 20 years. That's because the data prior to 1 year ago is dragging down (or hiding) the most recent data. And I don't know about you, but the roughly 8 percent impacts present-me much more than the percentages from 10 and 20 years ago. Again, a reason for giving more weight to the recent data.

Regardless, the plate has increased by almost 8 percent due to inflation and it's out of my direct control and influence.

In 2022, I had appendicitis leading to an [appendectomy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appendectomy). My plate got bigger because of an emergency.

Hedonic adaptation is more within your control. You get a raise. You buy a more expensive thing. You’ve made your plate bigger because the replacement cost might be the same, but sticking with the cheaper version would have been a lower replacement cost. 

The Diderot effect is when you buy a new pair of shoes. Now you decide to replace your wardrobe because all your clothes are old compared to your shoes. Then you decide to replace your furniture because your new clothes seem so out of place compared to the sofa you bought 15 years ago with multiple stains. You’ve made the plate bigger.

## The first brownie (short-term assets and income)

Characteristics:

1. Someone gives you something they have once or regularly.
2. Historically, the real rate is negative or neutral compared to the other categories.
3. Interest rates are in terms of [.Annual Percentage Yield](APY) and indicate excess money given to you.

A non-exhaustive list of ingredients that go into making the first brownie:

1. Cash (includes your paycheck): The ubiquitous method of exchange for the economy you’re participating in. Could be the [.United States Dollar](USD), precious metal coins back in the day, or cigarettes in those old prison movies.
2. Short-term bonds: Bonds with a maturity date of 1 year or less.
3. Certificates of deposit and share certificates: Cash held at a bank for a period, usually less than 10 years.

Some things that cause this brownie to get bigger and smaller:

1. Saving or reinvesting dividends.
2. Inflation and deflation.
3. An emergency.
4. The [hedonic treadmill](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill) and lifestyle inflation.
5. The [Diderot Effect](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diderot_effect).

Yep. Almost the same list as the plate.

This reveals the notion of spending less, earning more, or both.

Some might say compounding is the biggest addition, but this isn't the space for that complexity and debate. It'll be covered in a later section. Further, compounding falls under the "making more" part. But let's start with spending less as we tend to have more control over that.

A recommended precursor to spending less (and most things) is to get an idea of where you are, also known as tracking. Capture how much short-term assets you spend (the brownie you eat) and why you spent it. Focus on the categories you spend the most on and see if you can reduce or eliminate them. 

The plate gets smaller and the brownie may increase in volume.

The truth about making more is that not every employer or client will increase your income yearly. There aren’t mechanisms that cause regular increases. Sometimes, you must advocate for yourself or change how you earn income; otherwise, you are taking a pay cut because some aspects of the plate don't care about your situation. The volume of the brownie remains the same, but the plate gets bigger.

This is one reason I include liabilities in the portfolio. Paying off liabilities takes a bite of the brownie while making the plate proportionally smaller. It doesn't actually change the proportion of the portfolio.

I have 5,000 USD in liabilities. I have 5,000 USD in short-term assets. My ratio is 50:50. I spend 4,000 USD from short-term assets to pay a liability. Now, my liabilities are 1,000 USD and my short-term assets are 1,000 USD; still 50:50.

To change the allocation, we must change something else; spend less, earn more or both. 

Go ahead and pay off the credit card, but don’t run it up again; spend less. Be good at what you do and ask for a raise or increase your prices; earn more. Or both. 

Let’s say I pay off the 5,000 USD using the 5,000 USD. The plate is still there (mainly due to inflation and other bills), and I have no brownie. Then I earn 1,000 USD. My first brownie is back. Let’s say I have 200 USD in bills; the portfolio is about 20:80. I pay the bill, and the portfolio is 0:100. 

Some people are in a position where the phrase “feast or famine” truly applies. Further, in some cases, they can't see alternatives. Finally, sometimes they can see an alternative but feel it doesn’t apply to them (including spending less or earning more).

Next layer!

## The second brownie (growth assets)

Characteristics:

1. You typically convert short-term assets into something else you own, not a liability.
2. Historically, the real rate is positive and higher than the other categories.
3. Interest rates are in terms of APY and indicate excess money given to you.
4. Has a resell value that fluctuates more than short-term assets; a dollar is a dollar, and it's rare someone is willing to give you 2 dollars for 1.
5. When you sell the thing, it becomes a short-term asset. Even if you sell with the intention of immediately purchasing another asset.

A non-exhaustive list of ingredients that go into making the second brownie:

1. Corporate equities: Ownership shares in companies publicly and privately held.
2. Some forms of tangible things (real estate, artwork, and antique cars, for example).
3. Mutual and index funds in various forms that purchase corporate equities: You purchase a share in the fund and the fund's custodian purchases shares in companies based on some guidelines and guardrails established for the fund.

Some primary things causing this layer to grow and shrink:

1. The [risk premium](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskpremium.asp): Where we get the idea of greater risk, greater return, which isn't a hard truth; correlation is not causation. Just because it's risky doesn't mean there will be a reward (just look at most things we consider gambling). 
2. Selling some or buying more of the things.
3. Appreciation and depreciation of those things.
4. Reinvesting dividends.

We are buying something other than short-term assets, which is one reason this is a different brownie. Short-term and growth assets tend to have a low or negative correlation with one another, the definition of diversification.

That said, it’s important to note and remember that things can shift. Something you thought was a growth asset can turn into a liability or short-term asset based on the changing characteristics of the thing.

You can charge whatever you want for the thing when you sell it. Some questions this raises:

1. When do you need the short-term asset from the sale?
2. Will someone pay what you’re asking?
3. If so, will they do it in a timely manner?
4. Will you need to replace the thing with something similar?

This brings up the idea of liquidity. Liquidity is the time and cost it takes for something to be exchanged for something else. Short-term assets are considered very liquid, mainly because cash is an ingredient in that brownie. Growth assets usually have low liquidity. Low liquidity is a risk because you may be unable to "get at the money" when needed, the risk premium.

Back in the day, and I mean the 1970s and earlier back in the day, buying shares in a publicly traded company was pretty prohibitive because of the lack of liquidity. 

We’re talking old-school here. 

Let’s assume you could buy direct. You would give someone your money. They would generate a piece of paper representing your share in the company. You’d wait to get the paper. You would then have to hold onto it as proof of ownership. If the company ever decided to pay its shareholders, it must keep records of your ownership stake and cut you a check. You would also need to keep tabs in case you missed getting your cut, then use the paper to verify your claim of ownership. (Shares are like the corporate equivalent of printing money or a [community currency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_community_currencies_in_the_United_States.)

If you wanted to sell the share, you’d have to find someone willing to buy it. They’d have to give you money. You’d have to transfer ownership to this other person. Then give them the paper and let the company know to update their records. (Like transferring the title for a car or house.)

If you had to go through a broker (most times you did), you might have to pay fees of hundreds of dollars to pay them to do all of that for you.

In the twenty-first century, there are more options with varying fees ranging from 0 to a couple percent. Publicly traded company shares have become more liquid. And the old-school way still exists; old doesn’t mean bad or extinct. 

Compare that to a tangible asset like a painting. Again, you purchase the thing. You wait for the thing. Sometimes there’s a letter of authenticity you’ll want to keep. Now you want to sell the artwork. How long does finding someone willing to pay what you’re charging take? Again, risk.

Compare both to something you own and use, like a house. Historically, houses are growth assets. But, when you sell the manmade cave, you usually want to find another one. 

Regardless, once sold, this brownie gets a little smaller in volume.

Let's go back to risk for a second. We often conflate risk with volatility. Volatility is how much the thing you bought appreciates or depreciates in a given period. Volatility is great when it's going up and sucks when it's going down. The risky side of volatility is needing to sell and having to charge less than your cost basis for the thing being sold.

Cost basis is what you paid for the thing plus any additional related costs for maintenance and improvement; also known as the [total cost of ownership](/essays-and-editorials/finances/total-cost-of-ownership/). Just because you paid a lot for something doesn't mean someone later will pay your initial cost basis, much less anything extra. I buy a car for 10,000 USD. The chances of me selling it for 10,000 USD later is pretty slim. The chances of me selling it for 10,000 USD, plus the taxes I paid over the years, the interest paid on the loan I had at the time, the oil changes, tires, and so on, are even slimmer. When it comes to cars, we don't look at them like an asset, we look at them like a liability. We tend to look at homes as assets because we don't keep track of all the money spent over the course of ownership. Of course, we tend not to track similar things related to cars.

Many growth assets will pay some form of income, whether dividends or rent. The dividend and rent you receive, strictly speaking, is a short-term asset. 

## The condiments (negative correlation assets)

Characteristics:

1. You typically convert short-term assets into something else you own, not a liability.
2. Historically, the real rate may increase while other categories (specifically growth assets) decrease. The real rate is normally lower than growth assets or slightly negative.
3. Interest rates are in terms of APY and indicate excess money given to you.
4. Has a resell value that fluctuates.
5. When you sell the thing, it becomes a short-term asset.

In the United States, the asset type with the highest negative correlation historically to corporate equities is:

1. Long-term US treasuries: A loan to a government with a maturity date of around 30 years.

Primary things causing this layer to grow and shrink:

1. The [risk premium](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskpremium.asp).
2. Selling some or buying more of the things.
3. Appreciation and depreciation of those things.
4. Reinvesting dividends.

Yep. Same as the list for growth assets.

Many negatively correlated assets have a lower risk premium. The things that fall into this part of our dessert also tend to be less volatile.

When folks talk about a stock-bond portfolio, the benefit isn't in the type of asset, specifically company stocks and any old bonds. Humans have a tendency to try and expedite communication by cutting out the parts we think are superfluous. So, instead of saying, "A diversified collection of stocks in relatively stable companies and long-term treasuries," we just say, "stocks and bonds" and hope the other person unpacks it as we intended.

There are all types of companies, and they all have at least one share. They're not all growth assets and most of them will fail. 

There are all types of bonds. Corporate bonds, state municipal bonds, and federal government bonds. Short-, long-, and intermediate-term. Then there's the credit rating for the bond issuer; triple A, double A, and.

We say stocks and bonds as shorthand for growth and negative correlation. We want something with the characteristics described. Sticking with an asset type, despite a change in historical characteristics, would be a [foolish consistency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-Reliance).

Corporate equities historically have a positive real rate of return. Historically, negative correlation assets increase their real return rate when growth assets are decreasing in theirs. If this changes over a long enough period, we might want to look for a different asset type. We'll go into depth on correlations in a later section.

## The sprinkles (low correlation assets)

Characteristics:

1. You typically convert short-term assets into something else you own, not a liability.
2. Historically, the real rate may increase while other categories decrease, not limited to growth assets. The real rate is normally lower than growth assets or slightly negative.
3. Interest rates are in terms of APY and indicate excess money given to you.
4. Has a resell value that fluctuates.
5. When you sell the thing, it becomes a short-term asset.

In the United States, two asset types that historically fit these characteristics are:

1. Commodities: A basic good often exchanged for similar goods. The goods include metals, energy, livestock and meat, and agriculture. 
2. Gold: A specific type of commodity that has been historically used as currency (or to back currencies); no longer the case in most contemporary economies. It does have some utility in electronics.

Primary things causing this layer to grow and shrink:

1. The [risk premium](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskpremium.asp).
2. Selling some or buying more of the things.
3. Appreciation and depreciation of those things.

Almost the same list as growth and negative correlation, but notice we took out reinvesting dividends. Commodities typically don't pay a dividend. Further, they may be taxed differently than other types of assets when you sell them. In this sense, they are less investment and more speculation according to the definitions laid out by J. David Stein.

## Compounding

Back to the compounding debate and how much of a contributor it is.

If I give you a dollar every day for 5 days, that's your paycheck. That's linear (we'll start skipping after the first 10 days, so keep track of the day column): 

|Day |On-hand |Increase |New balance |
|:--:|:------:|:-------:|:----------:|
|1   |0       |1        |1           |
|2   |1       |1        |2           |
|3   |2       |1        |3           |
|4   |3       |1        |4           |
|5   |4       |1        |5           |
|6   |5       |1        |6           |
|7   |6       |1        |7           |
|8   |7       |1        |8           |
|9   |8       |1        |9           |
|10  |9       |1        |10          |
|15  |14      |1        |15          |
|20  |19      |1        |20          |
|25  |24      |1        |25          |
|30  |29      |1        |30          |
|35  |34      |1        |35          |
|40  |39      |1        |40          |
|50  |49      |1        |50          |

That's not bad. Double your money from day 1 to day 2. On day 3, the increase is only 50 percent, though. On day 4, the increase is 30 percent. On day 5, it's 25 percent. On day 6, it's 20 percent. Day 7, it's 16. When you have no money and are thinking 1 day at a time, every bit feels like a million.

Humans tend to have a difficult time thinking long-term and exponentially. We're much better at short-term and linear.

If I give you a dollar and only 10 percent of the amount you keep every day thereafter, that's exponential: 

|Day |On-hand |Increase |New balance |
|:--:|:------:|:-------:|:----------:|
|1   |0       |1        |1           |
|2   |1       |0.10     |1.10        |
|3   |1.10    |0.11     |1.21        |
|4   |1.21    |0.12     |1.32        |
|5   |1.32    |0.13     |1.45        |
|6   |1.45    |0.14     |1.59        |
|7   |1.59    |0.15     |1.74        |
|8   |1.74    |0.17     |1.91        |
|9   |1.91    |0.19     |2.10        |
|10  |2.10    |0.21     |2.31        |
|15  |3.47    |0.34     |3.81        |
|20  |5.56    |0.55     |6.06        |
|25  |8.85    |0.88     |9.73        |
|30  |14.23   |1.42     |15.65       |
|35  |22.90   |2.29     |25.19       |
|40  |36.86   |3.68     |40.54       |
|50  |96.23   |9.62     |105.85      |

From day 1 to day 2, it's kinda, "meh." Even up to day 6, you might think, "I'd rather have the dollar a day" (indicative of a steady paycheck and short-term linear thinking). Heck, it's not actually interesting until days 25 to 30 because that's the tipping point. 

That's the point where the 8 percent is more than you were earning each day in the linear example. Then 5 days later, you're increasing by over double what you were earning in the linear example. 5 days later, it's triple what you were increasing in the linear example and you have roughly the same balance; you have caught up to your earnings from the linear paycheck example. 10 days later, it's 9 times the increase of the linear example and twice the balance.

The other thing we can take away from the exponential table is what's referred to as the rule of 72. Basically, divide 72 by any rate of return (APY) and you will arrive at roughly the number of compounding periods it will take for a specific dollar amount to double. In our case, 72 divided by 10 is 7.2. It took about 8 days to go from 1 dollar to 2. It took about 16 days to go from 2 dollars to 4. We hit 8 dollars around day 20. And so on.

So, yes, compounding is very powerful. It also takes two things to really kick in:

1. time and
2. money to put somewhere to compound.

1 dollar at 1 percent APY in a regular savings account will double in 72 years. If I live hand-to-mouth, there aren't even seeds left to plant at that 1 percent return.

My regular dentist recommended someone else when it came time to remove my wisdom teeth. When I didn't react well to the estimated cost the other dentist quoted me, they said, "There are always places you can cut in your budget." Sure, I could have bitched about healthcare in the United States and my lot in life working slightly over minimum wage with health and dental insurance and how "the system" is out to screw us. But I didn't.

Instead, I laughed the laugh to keep from crying. I went to my car and did cry. I went back to my regular dentist, told him the story, and shed a tear or two in the process. He said, "That was pretty elitist. I guess I won't be recommending them anymore. The two teeth on the bottom are pretty far out and I can probably pull them. We'll bill it as an extraction. The four on the top (the top two are split) are pretty impacted and probably not going anywhere and I don't want to get near your sinuses. We'll leave those where they are and check on them regularly to ensure they haven't moved."

We extracted the teeth. Almost 20 years later, and 3 more dentists, the ones on the top haven't moved. And none of the dentists have recommended even trying.

It's difficult for humans to think long-term and exponentially. It's also difficult for us to understand and empathize with situations that aren't our own or those closest to us.

## Correlations

Two of the asset categories are in terms of correlation. Correlation is measured from -1 to 1. -1 means one of the things moves in the opposite direction of the other thing. 1 means both things move in the same direction. 0 means we're not sure in which direction one of them will move.

Let's look at correlations of one asset type in each part of the dessert, not including the plate. We'll use the following proxies inside an asset correlation tool provided by Portfolio Visualizer:

1. First brownie (short-term assets): Cash.
2. Second brownie (growth assets): A popular total US Stock Market index fund (VTSAX).
3. Condiments (negative correlation assets): Long-term US Treasuries (TLT).
4. Sprinkles (low correlation assets): Gold (GLD).

We'll only be able to do 10 years and roughly 19 years because the gold fund we're using started in 2004.

The hypotheses going in:

1. Cash will have a 0 or slightly negative correlation with our representative growth asset. 
2. Growth assets will have a 0 or negative correlation with the other three.
3. Long-term US Treasuries will have the greatest negative correlation with the growth asset.
4. Gold will have a close to 0 correlation with the other three.

For 10 years, we'll go from [February 2013 to the end of January 2023](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/asset-correlations?s=y&symbols=CASHX%2C+VTSAX%2CTLT%2C+GLD&startDate=02%2F01%2F2013&endDate=01%2F31%2F2023&timePeriod=2&tradingDays=60&months=12), here's what we find:

1. Cash is negatively correlated with the growth asset at -0.07; hypothesis confirmed.
2. Growth assets range in correlation from -0.07 (compared to cash) to 0.06 (compared to gold); hypothesis confirmed.
3. Long-term US Treasuries are negatively correlated with the growth asset at -0.03; this does not confirm the hypothesis.
4. Gold ranges in correlation with the other three from 0.06 (compared to the growth asset) to 0.4 (compared to long-term US Treasuries); this does not confirm the hypothesis.

In this case, there are no assets meeting the negative correlation characteristics; more on that later. 

Does this mean we should shift our thinking? Is this the proverbial paradigm shift you may have heard about? Do we need to find something else to replace long-term US Treasuries as a negative correlation asset before we start adding condiments? Or, if we already have long-term US Treasuries, should we rebalance into something else with a greater negative correlation?

Maybe. Only time will tell. Let's look at a period longer than 10 years and see what we find.

For this, we'll use the period from [February 2005 to the end of January 2023](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/asset-correlations?s=y&symbols=CASHX%2C+VTSAX%2CTLT%2C+GLD&startDate=02%2F01%2F2005&endDate=01%2F31%2F2023&timePeriod=2&tradingDays=60&months=12), and use the same hypotheses, here's what we find:

1. Cash is negatively correlated with the growth asset at -0.06; hypothesis confirmed.
2. Growth assets range in correlation from -0.19 (compared to long-term US Treasuries) to 0.08 (compared to gold); hypothesis confirmed.
3. Long-term US Treasuries are negatively correlated with the growth asset at -0.19; hypothesis confirmed.
4. Gold ranges in correlation with the other three from 0.08 (compared to the growth asset) to 0.23 (compared to long-term US Treasuries); the hypothesis is confirmed.

In this context, if something has a correlation of 0.4 or greater (40 percent or more), I wouldn't call it a low correlation, and it's definitely not negative. If something has a negative correlation between 0 and -0.1, I wouldn't say it was negative enough to be in the negative correlation category.

For the last 10 years, it seems like maybe we are seeing a shift in asset behavior. But, for the last almost 20 years, we're seeing the hypothesized behavior. The new behavior might indicate a shift is happening, and maybe we should keep an eye out. But until there are more time periods showing where the original hypothesis failed, I wouldn't make any drastic changes to anything.

As of this writing, I'm still in accumulation mode and only have the plate and first two brownies occupying any significant portion of my portfolio. And I still have a couple of years before I start seriously contemplating adding condiments and what types.

































The 5 types are:

1. Liabilities and expenses.
2. Short-term, liquid assets and income.
3. Growth assets.
4. Negative correlation assets.
5. Low correlation assets.

## Liabilities and expenses 

Standard bookkeeping definitions apply when it comes to characteristics for things we’d say are of this type, specifically:

1. A negative or neutral real rate of return.

When we say "real rate of return," we talk about a percentage rate less inflation. Typically finance folks don’t apply real rate of return to liabilities. If I lend you money and you pay me back over time. For you, it’s a liability. For me, it’s an asset. 

I suggest applying the same logic to both liabilities and assets to create a consistent measure and easily identify high interest versus low interest.

For example, you have a student loan with an interest rate of 3 percent. You can buy into a growth asset with a guaranteed nominal rate of return of 10 percent. 

Let’s say inflation is 3 percent. The real rate of the loan becomes 6, and the real rate of the growth asset becomes 7. Looking at it through this lens, paying the loan or buying into the growth asset is about equal. 

Let’s try inflation at 0. The loan becomes 3 percent, and the growth asset becomes 10 percent. Probably more worthwhile to buy into the growth asset.

And finally, let’s set inflation at 8 percent. The loan becomes 11, and the growth asset becomes 2 percent. It's probably more worthwhile to pay the liability.

Each thing inside a type can be broken down in a similar manner. For example:

- Liabilities:
	- Credit card: APR of 10 percent, the real rate is 12 percent, and balance of 1,000 [.United States Dollars](USD).
	- Student loan: APR of 6 percent, the real rate is 8 percent, and balance of 50,000 USD.

This can come in handy, especially for liabilities, when determining what to pay off first, either by using the snowball, avalanche, or hybrid method.

## Short-term assets and income

Short-term assets and income tend to have the following characteristics:

1. 12-to-84-month time horizon.
2. Historically have exhibited a low (often negative) real rate of return.
3. Things of this type can typically be easily exchanged for products and services or used to pay public and private debts.
4. Interest rates are in terms of [.Annual Percentage Yield](APY) and indicate excess money given to you.

When we say "historically," we’re talking about a decade or more for the thing under consideration. I tend to look at things in terms of 10, 20, 30, and 40 years.

As of this writing, the most ubiquitous thing falling into this type is cash. 

It’s important to note that cash isn’t the only thing with these characteristics. Short-term treasury bills in the [.United States](US) would also fit this type. A regular savings account at a financial institution. A share certificate or certificate of deposit.

Let’s go for an example.

You have a dollar (or whatever the equivalent name is in your economy). If inflation is 1 percent, the dollar has a real rate of return of negative 1 percent, and you are in an inflationary environment. If inflation is negative 1 percent, the dollar has a real rate of return of 1 percent, and you are in a deflationary environment. Historically, there are more inflationary years than deflationary years.

Let’s say you have a dollar in a savings account. The savings account has an APY of 1 percent. Let’s say we’re in an inflationary environment, and inflation is 3 percent. The real rate of return of the dollar is negative 2 percent. If we were in a deflationary environment, say negative 3 percent, the real rate of return for the dollar would be 4 percent. If the real rate of return stayed positive long enough (decades), we might consider cash to be a growth type.

The historical precedent being a negative real rate of return for things of this type is one reason many in the finance space advise against leaving cash under your mattress “doing nothing.” Instead, we strive to “put our dollars to work” by paying for liabilities or buying other asset types.

## The portfolio everyone has

If you participate in any economy, your portfolio has the previous two types.

Products and services you’re spending money on and the money you are holding or using to pay for the products and services.

Because we have more than 1 type in this portfolio, we can establish [guidelines and guardrails](/essays-and-editorials/guidelines-and-guardrails/) (also known as the allocation) for each type compared to the total of the portfolio. Establishing the guidelines guardrails lets us answer the question:

> Is the portfolio in balance?

In this context, the guideline is a target for the type. You may also have 2 to 4 guardrails. If we only do 2 guardrails, they establish a minimum and a maximum. If we use 4, we have a minimum, low, high, and maximum. 

After setting the guidelines and guardrails, we want to consider, and preferably capture, what to do if the proportion of the type goes below the low or minimum and above the high or maximum.

Let’s do it!

1. Take all the balances of your liabilities and add them together. (Optionally, you could include regular bills as well.)
2. Add up the current value of all your short-term assets.
3. Add those two previous numbers together; to get the total portfolio balance.
4. Divide the balance of your liabilities by the total portfolio balance to get the current allocation to liabilities in the portfolio.
5. Divide the value of short-term assets by the total portfolio balance to get the allocation of short-term assets.
6. Subtract the liabilities from short-term assets to get your net worth (presuming your portfolio only has these two types).

No judgment, blame, or shame here. This is just making things transparent; we’re washing windows. Not spiraling down a negative emotional and psychological path is sometimes easier said than done, depending on what’s revealed.

When I graduated from university, I had:

1. about 126,000 USD in liabilities, and 
2. about 1,000 USD in short-term assets. 
3. My total portfolio balance was 127,000.
4. My liabilities occupied 99 percent of the portfolio.
5. My short-term assets occupied the remaining 1 percent.
6. My net worth was negative 125,000 USD.

Back then, I didn’t do this exercise. Instead, I did what many of us do, I put blinders on, and as long as I could pay the immediate bills, I figured that was good enough. I went through a deep depression for at least 3 years. While money wasn’t the only reason, it played a large part. 

If present-me were in that situation and did this exercise, I think I could handle it much better even at the same income I had back then.

The results of this exercise give me the state of my financial universe. 

Let’s establish the initial guidelines and guardrails for this example.

1. Liabilities:
    - Maximum: 99 percent
    - High: 89
    - Target: 79
    - Low: 0
    - Minimum: 0
2. Short-term assets:
    - Maximum: 100
    - High: 90
    - Target: 6
    - Low: 4
    - Minimum: 3

Why did I choose those numbers?

I don’t want my liabilities to go higher than they are as a percentage of my portfolio; the maximum is set to where they are now. If liabilities exceed that maximum, I promise to put every extra dollar toward paying them. 

I want liabilities to decrease; the high and target are 10 and 20 percent less than the maximum. I want to be in a position where I check the portfolio regularly (monthly, quarterly, or annually) and the liabilities are at 0; that's where the low and minimum are set. If I can maintain an allocation of less than the maximum a few times, I might reduce the maximum, high, and target allocation amounts.

I want short-term assets to increase; the minimum and low are higher than their current allocation. The target feels reasonable while still somewhat audacious; 6 percent of 127,000 is 7,620, giving a decent runway for future liabilities and emergencies.

I'd like liabilities to be at 0, making it possible for short-term assets to become 100 percent, and 10 percent less than 100 is 90. 

The gaps between low and minimum and high and maximum are where decision-making becomes a bit looser. It opens the options of where to put the next dollar. The liabilities are at their maximum, and the short-term assets are below their minimum; therefore, the next dollar should probably go toward short-term assets.

In a way, this helps us follow the [Financial Order of Operations](/examinations/money-guy-foo/).

With this percent-based perspective, it's still numbers. However, instead of large numbers, like 127,000 USD, the numbers will never go above 100 or below 0. Looking at the actual dollar amounts can become overwhelming and inspire putting blinders on. You still need to know the numbers to run the calculations, but the emphasis is on moving 1 percent toward the targets.

Now, the rub.

Let's say we had a portfolio of 100,000 USD in liabilities and 100,000 in short-term assets, a 50:50 portfolio. Let's take 50,000 USD from the short-term assets and pay down the liabilities, giving us 50,000 USD in liabilities and 50,000 USD in short-term assets. It's still a 50:50 portfolio.

This is one reason we always want to include APR and APY for the type when making decisions. 

Let's say the liability was a credit card with an APR of 15 percent. Optionally, let's say inflation is 2 percent, making the APR 17 percent. Let's say the short-term assets are in a savings account with an APY of 2 percent with the same inflation, making the real rate of return 0 percent. 

Let's say the liability was a student loan with an APR of 2 percent; in the same inflationary environment, we get 4 percent.  Let's say the short-term assets are returning 6 percent, converted to a real rate of return, 4 percent. Now, the choice might be a bit more difficult.

Just to round out the examples, let's use the same student loan, and a savings account with a real rate of return of 8 percent. Now it might make more sense to continue putting money into savings.

Regardless, if either liabilities or short-term assets are way off from their targets, we would either rebalance the portfolio or adjust the targets.

Automating (or at least reducing) the decision-making is the superpower of putting all of your finances into a single portfolio view.

Of course, what savings account is paying a real rate of return of 8 percent?

## Growth assets

Growth assets tend to have the following characteristics:

1. Not sure when or if you’ll need to convert them to short-term assets; considered more "long-term."
2. Historically, have exhibited a positive (or high) real rate of return compared to other options.
3. Things of this type typically aren’t easily exchanged directly for products and services; they must be liquidated to short-term assets.
4. Interest rates are in terms of [.Annual Percentage Yield](APY) and indicate excess money given to you.

In the United States, the most well-known are corporate equities, also known as shares in [.United States](US) companies. According to [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/710711/return-on-equities-bonds-bills-usa/), the real rate of return for US equities from 2002 to 2019 was 7 percent per year. 

For comparison, the real rate of return for my regular savings account (short-term assets) was around negative 2 percent.

Two things I want to make sure of here:

1. The rate of return includes dividends paid to shareholders and appreciation of the resell value of the share, also known as Capital appreciation.
2. Growth assets as a type can be a bit confusing because there is a specific style of equity called growth, but that’s not what we’re talking about.

Typically, when you buy growth assets, you exchange your short-term assets for a different asset. In the case of US equities, you exchange for a share in the company. In the case of mutual funds, you’re buying a share in the fund; in turn, the fund's custodian buys individual equities.

Further, one thing that makes growth assets what they are is [the risk premium](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskpremium.asp). The risk premium is the excess return compared to the risk-free rate of return. Risk is different than volatility. Risk refers to the possibility of loss. Volatility refers to the swings of value for the thing. Risk and volatility are related but not the same.

Let’s go back to the 50:50 example portfolio:

- Liabilities: 
	- minimum and low of 0, 
	- a target of 79, 
	- high of 89, and 
	- a maximum of 99 percent. The current percentage of 99.
- Short-term assets: 
	- minimum of 1, 
	- low of 3, 
	- a target of 6, 
	- high of 90, and 
	- maximum of 100. Current percent of 1.

If I were to add growth assets, I’d look at the targets and get them to add to 100 percent:

- Liabilities: 79 percent.
- Short-term assets: 6 percent.
- Growth assets: 15 percent. 
	- For the guardrails, maybe we decide on a minimum of 0, a low of 5, a high of 20, and a maximum of 25 percent.

We could track individual things (or accounts) within each type to gain more insight.

Let's break down the liabilities, for example.

- Liabilities:
	- A credit card with a 15 percent real rate, and the balance is 15,000 USD.
	- A student loan with a 6 percent real rate and a balance of 85,000 USD.

In general, liabilities have a high real rate reducing your purchasing power. Short-term assets have a low real rate of return doing the same. Growth assets have a high real rate of return compared to other options working for the portfolio.

7.5 percent of the portfolio works hard against your purchasing power at 15 percent. 42.5 percent of the portfolio is working against your purchasing power at 6 percent. The other 50 percent, without anything in growth assets, is working against you, but by less than either of the liabilities.

Let's see what happens if we take 15,000 USD from short-term assets and pay off the credit card.

- Liabilities: 85,000 USD working against the portfolio at 6 percent.
- Short-term assets: 85,000 USD working again the portfolio at 2 percent.

It's still a 50:50 portfolio, but it's working against you less than before. 

Using the 85,000 USD to pay off the student loan would put you in a possible bind with no short-term assets. You might think we could reduce the short-term assets to 6 percent and use the difference to pay the student loan.

Let's see what would happen. 10,200 USD is 6 percent of 170,000 USD. So, we pay 74,800 USD on the student loan, bringing the balance of the student loan to, you guessed it, 10,200 USD; still 50:50. This might be a wise choice. Some alternatives to consider.

The first alternative would be to set a floor for your short-term assets. A fixed dollar amount you can't go below and isn't a percentage of the portfolio. You pay the student loan until your short-term assets hit the minimum or the floor you established, whichever comes first. When new money comes in, you pay your bills (including the student loan). If there's money left and your balance is greater than the floor you set, maybe that money should go toward the student loan. If there's money left over and your balance is less than the floor you set, maybe that money should stay in short-term assets.

A second alternative would be introducing something like growth assets and rebalancing (we'll rebalance the long way). Let's try and bring growth assets up to the target of 15 percent. 15 percent of 170,000 USD is 25,500, leaving 59,500 USD in short-term assets. The portfolio looks like this now:

- Liabilities: 50 percent, 85,000 USD.
- Short-term assets: 35 percent, 59,500 USD.
- Growth assets: 15 percent, 25,500 USD.

Let's start by taking 10 percent of the short-term assets and paying the student loan.

- Liabilities: 50 percent, 79,050 USD.
- Short-term assets: 34 percent, 53,550 USD.
- Growth assets: 16 percent, 25,500 USD.

Notice short-term assets only went down 1 percent as a total of the portfolio, and growth assets went up 1 percent?

Without new revenue coming in, liabilities will always be 50 percent until it reaches a 0 balance. Of course, without new revenue coming, all of the types would be at 0. No new money being generated also isn't realistic. Let's introduce income. We're going to try and keep the math simple. With each iteration, we'll have 1,000 USD to distribute how we see fit. 

(For the math and finance nerds, we won't worry about the complexities of interest calculations. We're going for a demonstration, not a picture-perfect simulation.)

We have 1,000 USD to distribute. Short-term and growth assets are higher than their targets. Let's put the 1,000 USD against the liabilities.

- Liabilities: 49.7 percent, 78,050 USD.
- Short-term assets: 34.1 percent, 53,550 USD.
- Growth assets: 16.2 percent, 25,500 USD.

Another 1,000 USD going toward the liabilities:

- Liabilities: 49.4 percent, 77,050 USD.
- Short-term assets: 34.3 percent, 53,550 USD.
- Growth assets: 16.3 percent, 25,500 USD.

It's slow going, but short-term and growth assets are steadily increasing the portion of the portfolio.











Let's take 8,500 USD from short-term assets and put it toward growth assets.

- Liabilities: 85,000 USD with 6 percent working against the portfolio.
- Short-term assets: 76,500 USD with 2 percent against.
- Growth assets: 8,500 USD with 7 percent working for the portfolio.

From a percent-perspective:

- Liabilities: 50 percent.
- Short-term assets: 45 percent.
- Growth assets: 5 percent.

The portfolio is still losing purchasing power despite the addition of growth assets. We would need to liabilities to be less than the growth assets





Not sure why this has been playing in my head recently, but here we are. I will start from the broad concepts and work down to the details. I will use contract-like language in the sense that defined terms will be capitalized throughout this article.

Assets are things you have that could be converted into cash (also known as liquidating). Liabilities are things you have that oblige you to repay. Net Worth is the result of taking the sum of the value of all your assets and subtracting the sum of the value of all your Liabilities.

Standard bookkeeping.

When discussing Portfolios, we typically speak only about Assets, our Asset Portfolio. As I've been learning more about finances, I've included Liabilities when I talk about my Portfolio. I've done so partly because I don't want to change what's included in my Net Worth calculations. By having both Assets and Liabilities be part of my Portfolio, I can give each Targets and Bands for each in my Portfolio. Further, if I were to use Liabilities to purchase one or more Assets, I get feedback from the portfolio.

Suppose I add the total of my Liabilities (as a positive number) to the total value of my Assets; this gives me the total value of the Portfolio. In that case, I can use it as the denominator to calculate the percentage each occupies in my Portfolio. Total Liabilities divided by the Portfolio's total (positive) value gives us the percentage Liabilities occupy. Total Assets divided by the Portfolio's total (positive) value gives us the percentage our Assets occupy.

For example, let's say I have 40,000 USD of value in a retirement account and another 5,000 USD in cash; I have a total of 45,000 USD in Assets. Now, let's say I have a car loan of 5,000 [.United States Dollars](USD) and a student loan of 50,000 USD; I have a total of 55,000 USD in Liabilities. From here, we can get 3 different numbers:

1. Net Worth: `45,000 - 55,000 = -10,000`
2. Assets as a percent: `45,000 / (45,000 + 55,000) = 0.45 (or 45 percent)`
3. Liabilities as a percent: `55,000 / (45,000 + 55,000) = 0.55 (or 55 percent)`

If my Net Worth is negative, I know my Liabilities are outpacing my Assets without any further calculations. That's one of the things that makes Net Worth powerful from a feedback perspective. With that said, these three numbers combined form an informational foundation to set goals (Targets) and make changes.

A Target is the ideal percentage of the portfolio for a given segment. A Band is a deviation from the Target we're okay with.

Generally speaking, we want Liabilities to occupy a smaller percentage than our Assets, thereby resulting in a positive Net Worth. If someone came along and wanted to call in our debt (Liabilities), we might still have money left over after selling our Assets.

In investing terms, we would say "margin" for taking on a Liability to purchase some Asset. We would say "margin call" when the person or organization who gave us the money demanded it back.

My ideal (Target) for Liabilities is 0 percent. Therefore, my ideal (Target) for Assets is 100 percent. With that said, I like to eat, have a place to live, and so on, all of which either are Liabilities in themselves or have Liabilities associated with them through their [total cost of ownership](/essays-and-editorials/finances/total-cost-of-ownership/).

0 percent Liabilities is impossible to maintain day-to-day. Therefore, I want to set bands for myself. I find it easiest to start where you are. Let's go back to the example of the person with 45 percent Assets and 55 percent Liabilities. This isn't about judgment and criticism; it's meeting ourselves where we are so we can move to where we want to be.

In terms of Bands, I typically set 4. There's a maximum, a high, a low, and a minimum. For this person, maybe they start with:

- maximum 55 percent,
- high of 50 percent,
- a Target of 45, 
- low of 40, and
- minimum of 35.

The next step is to see if I can get my actual percentage to match the Target. When it does, maybe I move the Target down a bit, keeping the same distance from the Target for the Bands, like the following:

- Maximum 50 percent,
- high of 45 percent,
- a new Target of 40, 
- low of 35, and
- minimum of 30.

In this sense, the Target and Bands become the [guideline and guardrails](/essays-and-editorials/guidelines-and-guardrails/), respectively.

Because Assets aren't typically correlated with one another, we could say we have a diversified Portfolio.

Let's break Assets and Liabilities down into segments as well.

## Breaking down Assets

I've come to recognize 4 segments of Assets:

1. Liquid: 
	1. These are Assets that are easily exchanged for products, services, and repaying Liabilities. 
	2. These Assets typically have a real rate of return less than inflation; the quantity and quality of products and services you can purchase diminish over time.
	3. They may have a holding period of up to 1 year.
2. Growth: 
	1. These are Assets that aren't easily exchanged for products, services, and repaying Liabilities. 
	2. These Assets have a historical real rate of return greater than inflation; that's why we call them Growth Assets. 
	3. We're not talking about growth in terms of style boxes for equities, which are a specific type of Growth Asset.
	4. The value of these Assets tends to fluctuate day-to-day. However, over the course of decades, their value tends to increase.
3. Negative Correlation: 
	1. These are Assets that aren't easily exchanged for products, services, and repaying Liabilities.
	2. The historical real rate of return for these Assets is less important than their value.
	3. The value of these Assets tends to fluctuate less day-to-day than Growth Assets, and the value or income generated tends to increase when the value of Growth Assets decreases.
	4. These Assets also tend to have a low or negative correlation with Liquid Assets.
4. Low Correlation:
	1. These are Assets that aren't easily exchanged for products, services, and repaying Liabilities.
	2. The value of these Assets may fluctuate daily compared to Growth Assets. However, they typically fluctuate for different reasons; this is what gives them a low correlation to Growth Assets specifically and all three of the others generally.

It's important to note and reiterate; we're not talking about specific types of Assets. We are talking about the characteristics of Assets. These four segments of Assets likely exist if an economy is at play.

Thinking back to old prison and war movies where cigarettes and matches could be traded for products and services. In that context, they were a Liquid Asset. In another context, they might be considered a Liability.

Further, if you are operating within an economy, you have a Portfolio consisting of Assets and Liabilities. Specifically Liquid Assets, like your time and labor.

When we talk about historical returns, in most cases, we're talking in terms of decades. I'll give some examples in the United States for each segment, as of this writing, based on the characteristic of the Asset:

1. Liquid: 
	1. The United States Dollar, also known as cash.
	2. [.Certificates of Deposit](CDs) or Share Certificates with a maturity date of one year or less.
	3. Government and Corporate Bonds with a one-year or less maturity date.
2. Growth: Shares in corporations, also known as equities.
3. Negative Correlation: Long-Term United States Treasury Bonds.
4. Low Correlation: Gold and other commodities.

I intentionally gave more for the Liquid Asset segment so I could say the following. There may come a time when these things change. The characteristics of Share Certificates, for example, may hit a point where their historical real rate of return and other characteristics causes them to move to Low Correlation instead of Liquid. The same could be said for gold, possibly moving to something more Liquid-like.

When I talk about the allocation of the Asset Portfolio, these are the segments I use. When I design systems, I look to have three qualities:

1. self-maintaining,
2. self-cleansing, and
3. the ability to opt-in to complexity.

For years my Asset Portfolio was completely Liquid. My Liabilities outweighed my Assets by a lot. If I did the calculations, I would have been 60 percent Liabilities and 40 percent Assets. And that 40 percent was all Liquid Assets. Then I started contributing to my employer's 401k plan. I was purchasing Growth Assets in the form of shares in indexed mutual funds, opting into more complexity. 

I set myself Targets and Bands for how much I wanted in Liquid Assets and how much I wanted in Growth Assets. In December 2020, my Liabilities hit 0 for the first time in almost 20 years, and I set the Target for Liabilities to 0 percent with a high Band of 0.5 percent and a maximum band of 1 percent. I may purchase something with a loan in the future, and the high and maximum Bands may change. But, for now, this works.

I also set Targets and Bands for Liquid and Growth in my Asset Portfolio. 

Returning to the self-maintaining concept, I set milestone events to change the allocation and increase complexity. When the Asset Portfolio hits a certain value, I'll add in Negative Correlation assets. The Portfolio is a ways off from that point. Therefore, I'm not committing myself to a specific Asset because I don't know what Assets will fall into that category when it hits that milestone. Still, I know what characteristics I'll look for when it does.

## Breaking down Liabilities
