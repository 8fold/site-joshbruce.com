# Net worth and portfolios

{!! dateblock !!}

Assertions:

1. Everyone has a portfolio.
2. Every portfolio has 5 types or categories.
3. Each type is based on characteristics, not the thing itself.
4. Things may move between types based on historical performance.

Let’s try a layer cake analogy.

We’ll have a plate, up to two layers in the cake, and potential for icing and sprinkles.

The plate represents your liabilities and expenses; time or money you exchange with other people. Everyone gets a plate.

The base layer of the cake are your short-term assets and income; lifetime you have or money you exchange with other people, usually on liabilities. Everyone has at least one layer to their cake. For some people it might be small as a proportion of the plate, their liabilities are greater than their short-term assets. Do others this layer might be edge-to-edge and 4 times thicker than the plate; the frugal folks. And all points in between.

The second layer represent what we call your growth assets. Not everyone has this layer. For others, this layer dwarfs the first layer.

The icing is where we would put negatively correlated assets. These are things that tend act differently than growth assets. Not everyone has icing. Some people’s have more icing than they do the first and second layers of the cake.

The sprinkles are assets with a low correlation to the other layers and icing. Again, some people really like sprinkles, possibly to the point of only having the first layer and sprinkles.

From a quantity perspective, you can have all the same volume of stuff making up this dessert. However, When looking at the ratio of these components can shift. And they can shift for all sorts of reasons. 

Let’s go deeper.

We’ll give the general characteristics of each, some things that fall into each as of this writing, and how one gets larger or smaller in volume without necessarily changing the quantity of things in it.

## The plate (liabilities and expenses)

Characteristics:

1. You give something you have to someone else one-time or on a regular basis.
2. Historically, real rate is often the most negative compared to the 5 dessert components.
3. Interest rates are in terms of [.Annual Percentage Rate](APR) and indicate excess money given to someone else.

By “historically” we’re talking in terms of decades; 10, 20, 30, 40 and so on years. We typically give more weight to recent data, as things do change and revolve over time. What was true 40 years ago may not be true now, and including the data from 40 years ago could skew averages and medians.

When I say “real rate” we take the APR and add the inflation rate.

You borrow money from me, it goes here. We agree to a 0 percent APR and inflation is at 3 percent. The real rate for this loan is 3 percent.

Ingredients that go into making the plate:

1. Recurring bills: Like utilities, rent, food, and similar purchases.
2. Terminal loans: Like a mortgage or car loan.
3. Revolving loans: Like credit cards and lines of credit.
4. Future replacement costs: A cellphone has a useful life of 2 to 5 years. A roof has a useful life of 15 to 20 years.

This is not an exhaustive list. And the key characteristic is that you can’t eat a plate. The ingredients making up the plate are for and to someone else.

There are 4 major things that can make the plate grow and shrink; 2 are most likely out of your control:

1. Inflation and deflation.
2. An emergency.
3. The [hedonic treadmill](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill) and lifestyle inflation.
4. The [Diderot Effect](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diderot_effect).

It’s worth noting that the plate can grow and shrink independently from the other parts of the dessert; just like all the other parts of the dessert.

Inflation is the tendency for the same quantity of products and services to cost more in the over time. This also goes back to the commentary on favoring recent data. Let’s look at the [.United States Bureau of Labor Statics](BLS) [.Consumer Price Index](https://www.bls.gov/charts/consumer-price-index/consumer-price-index-by-category-line-chart.htm) data. We’ll use all items for each month.

From February 2022 through January 2023 (12 months), the average rate of inflation was: 7.9 percent. From February 2013 through January 2023 (120 months or 10 year) the average was: 2.5 percent. From February 2003 through January 2023 (20 years) the average was: 2.49 percent.

There were some deflation months in 2009. Of course, that was during [The Great Recession](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession), and inflation was an average of 3 to 4 percent the previous year.

Let me say, the me living in 2023 is impacted my be the last year than the last 20 years. Again, giving slightly more weight to recent data seems valid in this context.

So, in the last year, the plate has increased by almost 8 percent. Out of your control.

In 2022, I had appendicitis leading to an [appendectomy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appendectomy), my plate got bigger because of an emergency.

Hedonic adaptation is more within your control. You get a raise. You buy a more expensive thing. You’ve made your plate bigger because the cost to replace might be the same, but if you stick with the cheaper version, it would be less expensive. 

The Diderot effect is when you buy, say, a new pair of shoes. Now you feel the need to replace your wardrobe because all your clothes are really old. Then you decide to replace your furniture, because your new clothes seem so out of place compared to the sofa you bought 15 years ago with the multiple stains. You’ve made the plate bigger.

## The first layer of the cake (short-terms assets and income)

Characteristics:

1. Someone gives you something they have one-time or on a regular basis.
2. Historically, real rate is negative or neutral compared to the 5 dessert components.
3. Interest rates are in terms of [.Annual Percentage Yield](APY) and indicate excess money given to you.

Non-exhaustive list of ingredients that go into making the first layer:

1. Cash (includes your paycheck): The ubiquitous method of exchange for the economy you’re participating in. Could be the [.United States Dollar](USD), gold coins back in the day, or cigarettes in those old prison movies.
2. Short-term bonds: Bonds with a maturity date of 1 year or less.
3. Certificates of deposit and share certificates: Cash held at a bank for a period, usually less than 10 years.

Some things that cause this layer to get bigger and smaller:

1. Inflation and deflation.
2. An emergency.
3. The [hedonic treadmill](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill) and lifestyle inflation.
4. The [Diderot Effect](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diderot_effect).

Yep. Same list as the plate.

The biggest addition here is to spend less, make more, or both.

A recommended precursor to spending less (and most things really) is to get an idea of where you are; also known as tracking. Focus on the items that take up the most space. The plate gets smaller and it’s possible this layer actually increases in volume.

The truth of making more is that often, as your salary increases, there aren’t mechanisms that cause regular increases. In some cases you’ll need to advocate for yourself or change how you earn income.

This is one reason I include liabilities in the portfolio. Paying off liabilities takes a bite of the cake, while make the plate proportionally smaller.

I have 5,000 USD in liabilities. I have 5,000 USD in short-term assets. My ratio is 50:50. I spend 4,000 USD from short-term assetS to pay a liability. Now, my liabilities are 1,000 USD and my short-term assets are 1,000 USD; still 50:50.

To change the allocation, we must change something else; spend less, earn more, or both. 

Go ahead and pay off the credit card, but don’t run it up again; spend less. Be good at what you do and ask for a raise or increase your prices; earn more. Or both.

Let’s say I pay off the 5,000 USD using the 5,000 USD. The plate is still there (inflation and other bills), and I have no first layer on my cake. Then I earn 1,000 USD. My first layer is back. Let’s say I have 200 USD in bills to pay; the portfolio is about 20:80.

Some people are in a position where the phrase “feast or famine” truly applies. Further, in some cases they cannot see alternatives. Finally, sometimes they can see an alternative but feel it doesn’t apply to them.

Next layer!

## The second layer (growth assets)

Characteristics:

1. You typically convert short-term assets into something else you then own; not a liability.
2. Historically, real rate is positive and higher than all other elements of this dessert.
3. Interest rates are in terms of [.Annual Percentage Yield](APY) and indicate excess money given to you.
4. Has a resell value that fluctuates.

Non-exhaustive list of ingredients that go into making the first layer:

1. Corporate equities: Ownership shares in companies publicly and privately held.
2. Some forms and organization of tangible things (real estate, artwork, and antique cars, for example).
3. Mutual and index funds in various forms that invest in corporate equities: You purchase a share in the fund, and the custodian of the fund purchases share in companies based on some guidelines and guardrails established for the fund.

Three main things causing this layer to grow and shrink:

1. Selling the things.
2. Buying more of those things.
3. Appreciation and depreciation of the things.

The fact we are buying something other than currency is also why this is a different layer to the cake. With that said, it’s important to note and remember that things can shift; assets becoming one with the plate or things that were once growth assets fitting more into short-term assets.

You can charge whatever you want for the thing. Some questions this relationship raises:

1. When do you need the short-term asset from the sale?
2. Will someone pay what you’re asking?
3. If so, will they do it in a timely manner?
4. Will you need to replace the thing with something similar?

This brings up the idea of liquidity. Liquidity is the time and cost it takes for something to be exchanged for something else. Short-term assets are considered very liquid, mainly because cash falls in there. Growth assets are usually considered to have low liquidity, this is a small contributing factor to their growth nature.

Back in the day, and I mean 50-plus years ago, buying shares in a publicly traded company was pretty prohibitive because of the lack of liquidity. We’re talking old school here. Let’s assume you could buy direct. You would give someone your money. They would generate a piece of paper representing your share in the company. You’d wait to get the paper. You would then have to hold onto it as proof of ownership. (Think paper money, only it’s not cash and you usually can’t trade it directly for products and services.)

If you wanted to self the share, you’d have to find someone willing to buy it. They’d have to give you money. You’d have to transfer ownership to this other person. Then give them the piece of paper. (Like transferring the title for a car or house.)

If you had to go through a broker (most times you did), you might have to pay fees of hundreds of dollars to pay them to do it for you.

In the twenty-first century though, there are way more options with varying fees ranging from 0 to a couple percent. Publicly traded company shares have become more liquid. And, the old school way still exists; old doesn’t mean bad or extinct. 

Compare that to a tangible asset like a painting. Again, you purchase the thing. You wait for the thing. Sometimes there’s a letter of authenticity you’ll want to keep. Now you want to sell the artwork. How long will it take you to find someone willing to pay what you’re charging?

Regardless, once sold, this layer gets a little smaller in volume.

The other, and probably main reason growth assets have the qualities they have is [the risk premium](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskpremium.asp). Liquidity, or lack thereof, is a type of risk. However, it’s not usually the one people think about in this context. Often we conflate risk with volatility. Volatility is how much the thing you bought appreciates or depreciates in a given period.

The real risk is the likelihood that you won’t be able to sell the thing you bought 































The 5 types are:

1. Liabilities and expenses.
2. Short-term, liquid assets and income.
3. Growth assets.
4. Negative correlation assets.
5. Low correlation assets.

## Liabilities and expenses 

Standard bookkeeping definitions apply when it comes to characteristics for things we’d say are of this type, specifically:

1. A negative or neutral real rate of return.

When we say "real rate of return," we talk about a percentage rate less inflation. Typically finance folks don’t apply real rate of return to liabilities. If I lend you money and you pay me back over time. For you, it’s a liability. For me, it’s an asset. 

I suggest applying the same logic to both liabilities and assets to create a consistent measure and easily identify high interest versus low interest.

For example, you have a student loan with an interest rate of 3 percent. You can buy into a growth asset with a guaranteed nominal rate of return of 10 percent. 

Let’s say inflation is 3 percent. The real rate of the loan becomes 6, and the real rate of the growth asset becomes 7. Looking at it through this lens, paying the loan or buying into the growth asset is about equal. 

Let’s try inflation at 0. The loan becomes 3 percent, and the growth asset becomes 10 percent. Probably more worthwhile to buy into the growth asset.

And finally, let’s set inflation at 8 percent. The loan becomes 11, and the growth asset becomes 2 percent. It's probably more worthwhile to pay the liability.

Each thing inside a type can be broken down in a similar manner. For example:

- Liabilities:
	- Credit card: APR of 10 percent, the real rate is 12 percent, and balance of 1,000 [.United States Dollars](USD).
	- Student loan: APR of 6 percent, the real rate is 8 percent, and balance of 50,000 USD.

This can come in handy, especially for liabilities, when determining what to pay off first, either by using the snowball, avalanche, or hybrid method.

## Short-term assets and income

Short-term assets and income tend to have the following characteristics:

1. 12-to-84-month time horizon.
2. Historically have exhibited a low (often negative) real rate of return.
3. Things of this type can typically be easily exchanged for products and services or used to pay public and private debts.
4. Interest rates are in terms of [.Annual Percentage Yield](APY) and indicate excess money given to you.

When we say "historically," we’re talking about a decade or more for the thing under consideration. I tend to look at things in terms of 10, 20, 30, and 40 years.

As of this writing, the most ubiquitous thing falling into this type is cash. 

It’s important to note that cash isn’t the only thing with these characteristics. Short-term treasury bills in the [.United States](US) would also fit this type. A regular savings account at a financial institution. A share certificate or certificate of deposit.

Let’s go for an example.

You have a dollar (or whatever the equivalent name is in your economy). If inflation is 1 percent, the dollar has a real rate of return of negative 1 percent, and you are in an inflationary environment. If inflation is negative 1 percent, the dollar has a real rate of return of 1 percent, and you are in a deflationary environment. Historically, there are more inflationary years than deflationary years.

Let’s say you have a dollar in a savings account. The savings account has an APY of 1 percent. Let’s say we’re in an inflationary environment, and inflation is 3 percent. The real rate of return of the dollar is negative 2 percent. If we were in a deflationary environment, say negative 3 percent, the real rate of return for the dollar would be 4 percent. If the real rate of return stayed positive long enough (decades), we might consider cash to be a growth type.

The historical precedent being a negative real rate of return for things of this type is one reason many in the finance space advise against leaving cash under your mattress “doing nothing.” Instead, we strive to “put our dollars to work” by paying for liabilities or buying other asset types.

## The portfolio everyone has

If you participate in any economy, your portfolio has the previous two types.

Products and services you’re spending money on and the money you are holding or using to pay for the products and services.

Because we have more than 1 type in this portfolio, we can establish [guidelines and guardrails](/essays-and-editorials/guidelines-and-guardrails/) (also known as the allocation) for each type compared to the total of the portfolio. Establishing the guidelines guardrails lets us answer the question:

> Is the portfolio in balance?

In this context, the guideline is a target for the type. You may also have 2 to 4 guardrails. If we only do 2 guardrails, they establish a minimum and a maximum. If we use 4, we have a minimum, low, high, and maximum. 

After setting the guidelines and guardrails, we want to consider, and preferably capture, what to do if the proportion of the type goes below the low or minimum and above the high or maximum.

Let’s do it!

1. Take all the balances of your liabilities and add them together. (Optionally, you could include regular bills as well.)
2. Add up the current value of all your short-term assets.
3. Add those two previous numbers together; to get the total portfolio balance.
4. Divide the balance of your liabilities by the total portfolio balance to get the current allocation to liabilities in the portfolio.
5. Divide the value of short-term assets by the total portfolio balance to get the allocation of short-term assets.
6. Subtract the liabilities from short-term assets to get your net worth (presuming your portfolio only has these two types).

No judgment, blame, or shame here. This is just making things transparent; we’re washing windows. Not spiraling down a negative emotional and psychological path is sometimes easier said than done, depending on what’s revealed.

When I graduated from university, I had:

1. about 126,000 USD in liabilities, and 
2. about 1,000 USD in short-term assets. 
3. My total portfolio balance was 127,000.
4. My liabilities occupied 99 percent of the portfolio.
5. My short-term assets occupied the remaining 1 percent.
6. My net worth was negative 125,000 USD.

Back then, I didn’t do this exercise. Instead, I did what many of us do, I put blinders on, and as long as I could pay the immediate bills, I figured that was good enough. I went through a deep depression for at least 3 years. While money wasn’t the only reason, it played a large part. 

If present-me were in that situation and did this exercise, I think I could handle it much better even at the same income I had back then.

The results of this exercise give me the state of my financial universe. 

Let’s establish the initial guidelines and guardrails for this example.

1. Liabilities:
    - Maximum: 99 percent
    - High: 89
    - Target: 79
    - Low: 0
    - Minimum: 0
2. Short-term assets:
    - Maximum: 100
    - High: 90
    - Target: 6
    - Low: 4
    - Minimum: 3

Why did I choose those numbers?

I don’t want my liabilities to go higher than they are as a percentage of my portfolio; the maximum is set to where they are now. If liabilities exceed that maximum, I promise to put every extra dollar toward paying them. 

I want liabilities to decrease; the high and target are 10 and 20 percent less than the maximum. I want to be in a position where I check the portfolio regularly (monthly, quarterly, or annually) and the liabilities are at 0; that's where the low and minimum are set. If I can maintain an allocation of less than the maximum a few times, I might reduce the maximum, high, and target allocation amounts.

I want short-term assets to increase; the minimum and low are higher than their current allocation. The target feels reasonable while still somewhat audacious; 6 percent of 127,000 is 7,620, giving a decent runway for future liabilities and emergencies.

I'd like liabilities to be at 0, making it possible for short-term assets to become 100 percent, and 10 percent less than 100 is 90. 

The gaps between low and minimum and high and maximum are where decision-making becomes a bit looser. It opens the options of where to put the next dollar. The liabilities are at their maximum, and the short-term assets are below their minimum; therefore, the next dollar should probably go toward short-term assets.

In a way, this helps us follow the [Financial Order of Operations](/examinations/money-guy-foo/).

With this percent-based perspective, it's still numbers. However, instead of large numbers, like 127,000 USD, the numbers will never go above 100 or below 0. Looking at the actual dollar amounts can become overwhelming and inspire putting blinders on. You still need to know the numbers to run the calculations, but the emphasis is on moving 1 percent toward the targets.

Now, the rub.

Let's say we had a portfolio of 100,000 USD in liabilities and 100,000 in short-term assets, a 50:50 portfolio. Let's take 50,000 USD from the short-term assets and pay down the liabilities, giving us 50,000 USD in liabilities and 50,000 USD in short-term assets. It's still a 50:50 portfolio.

This is one reason we always want to include APR and APY for the type when making decisions. 

Let's say the liability was a credit card with an APR of 15 percent. Optionally, let's say inflation is 2 percent, making the APR 17 percent. Let's say the short-term assets are in a savings account with an APY of 2 percent with the same inflation, making the real rate of return 0 percent. 

Let's say the liability was a student loan with an APR of 2 percent; in the same inflationary environment, we get 4 percent.  Let's say the short-term assets are returning 6 percent, converted to a real rate of return, 4 percent. Now, the choice might be a bit more difficult.

Just to round out the examples, let's use the same student loan, and a savings account with a real rate of return of 8 percent. Now it might make more sense to continue putting money into savings.

Regardless, if either liabilities or short-term assets are way off from their targets, we would either rebalance the portfolio or adjust the targets.

Automating (or at least reducing) the decision-making is the superpower of putting all of your finances into a single portfolio view.

Of course, what savings account is paying a real rate of return of 8 percent?

## Growth assets

Growth assets tend to have the following characteristics:

1. Not sure when or if you’ll need to convert them to short-term assets; considered more "long-term."
2. Historically, have exhibited a positive (or high) real rate of return compared to other options.
3. Things of this type typically aren’t easily exchanged directly for products and services; they must be liquidated to short-term assets.
4. Interest rates are in terms of [.Annual Percentage Yield](APY) and indicate excess money given to you.

In the United States, the most well-known are corporate equities, also known as shares in [.United States](US) companies. According to [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/710711/return-on-equities-bonds-bills-usa/), the real rate of return for US equities from 2002 to 2019 was 7 percent per year. 

For comparison, the real rate of return for my regular savings account (short-term assets) was around negative 2 percent.

Two things I want to make sure of here:

1. The rate of return includes dividends paid to shareholders and appreciation of the resell value of the share, also known as Capital appreciation.
2. Growth assets as a type can be a bit confusing because there is a specific style of equity called growth, but that’s not what we’re talking about.

Typically, when you buy growth assets, you exchange your short-term assets for a different asset. In the case of US equities, you exchange for a share in the company. In the case of mutual funds, you’re buying a share in the fund; in turn, the fund's custodian buys individual equities.

Further, one thing that makes growth assets what they are is [the risk premium](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskpremium.asp). The risk premium is the excess return compared to the risk-free rate of return. Risk is different than volatility. Risk refers to the possibility of loss. Volatility refers to the swings of value for the thing. Risk and volatility are related but not the same.

Let’s go back to the 50:50 example portfolio:

- Liabilities: 
	- minimum and low of 0, 
	- a target of 79, 
	- high of 89, and 
	- a maximum of 99 percent. The current percentage of 99.
- Short-term assets: 
	- minimum of 1, 
	- low of 3, 
	- a target of 6, 
	- high of 90, and 
	- maximum of 100. Current percent of 1.

If I were to add growth assets, I’d look at the targets and get them to add to 100 percent:

- Liabilities: 79 percent.
- Short-term assets: 6 percent.
- Growth assets: 15 percent. 
	- For the guardrails, maybe we decide on a minimum of 0, a low of 5, a high of 20, and a maximum of 25 percent.

We could track individual things (or accounts) within each type to gain more insight.

Let's break down the liabilities, for example.

- Liabilities:
	- A credit card with a 15 percent real rate, and the balance is 15,000 USD.
	- A student loan with a 6 percent real rate and a balance of 85,000 USD.

In general, liabilities have a high real rate reducing your purchasing power. Short-term assets have a low real rate of return doing the same. Growth assets have a high real rate of return compared to other options working for the portfolio.

7.5 percent of the portfolio works hard against your purchasing power at 15 percent. 42.5 percent of the portfolio is working against your purchasing power at 6 percent. The other 50 percent, without anything in growth assets, is working against you, but by less than either of the liabilities.

Let's see what happens if we take 15,000 USD from short-term assets and pay off the credit card.

- Liabilities: 85,000 USD working against the portfolio at 6 percent.
- Short-term assets: 85,000 USD working again the portfolio at 2 percent.

It's still a 50:50 portfolio, but it's working against you less than before. 

Using the 85,000 USD to pay off the student loan would put you in a possible bind with no short-term assets. You might think we could reduce the short-term assets to 6 percent and use the difference to pay the student loan.

Let's see what would happen. 10,200 USD is 6 percent of 170,000 USD. So, we pay 74,800 USD on the student loan, bringing the balance of the student loan to, you guessed it, 10,200 USD; still 50:50. This might be a wise choice. Some alternatives to consider.

The first alternative would be to set a floor for your short-term assets. A fixed dollar amount you can't go below and isn't a percentage of the portfolio. You pay the student loan until your short-term assets hit the minimum or the floor you established, whichever comes first. When new money comes in, you pay your bills (including the student loan). If there's money left and your balance is greater than the floor you set, maybe that money should go toward the student loan. If there's money left over and your balance is less than the floor you set, maybe that money should stay in short-term assets.

A second alternative would be introducing something like growth assets and rebalancing (we'll rebalance the long way). Let's try and bring growth assets up to the target of 15 percent. 15 percent of 170,000 USD is 25,500, leaving 59,500 USD in short-term assets. The portfolio looks like this now:

- Liabilities: 50 percent, 85,000 USD.
- Short-term assets: 35 percent, 59,500 USD.
- Growth assets: 15 percent, 25,500 USD.

Let's start by taking 10 percent of the short-term assets and paying the student loan.

- Liabilities: 50 percent, 79,050 USD.
- Short-term assets: 34 percent, 53,550 USD.
- Growth assets: 16 percent, 25,500 USD.

Notice short-term assets only went down 1 percent as a total of the portfolio, and growth assets went up 1 percent?

Without new revenue coming in, liabilities will always be 50 percent until it reaches a 0 balance. Of course, without new revenue coming, all of the types would be at 0. No new money being generated also isn't realistic. Let's introduce income. We're going to try and keep the math simple. With each iteration, we'll have 1,000 USD to distribute how we see fit. 

(For the math and finance nerds, we won't worry about the complexities of interest calculations. We're going for a demonstration, not a picture-perfect simulation.)

We have 1,000 USD to distribute. Short-term and growth assets are higher than their targets. Let's put the 1,000 USD against the liabilities.

- Liabilities: 49.7 percent, 78,050 USD.
- Short-term assets: 34.1 percent, 53,550 USD.
- Growth assets: 16.2 percent, 25,500 USD.

Another 1,000 USD going toward the liabilities:

- Liabilities: 49.4 percent, 77,050 USD.
- Short-term assets: 34.3 percent, 53,550 USD.
- Growth assets: 16.3 percent, 25,500 USD.

It's slow going, but short-term and growth assets are steadily increasing the portion of the portfolio.











Let's take 8,500 USD from short-term assets and put it toward growth assets.

- Liabilities: 85,000 USD with 6 percent working against the portfolio.
- Short-term assets: 76,500 USD with 2 percent against.
- Growth assets: 8,500 USD with 7 percent working for the portfolio.

From a percent-perspective:

- Liabilities: 50 percent.
- Short-term assets: 45 percent.
- Growth assets: 5 percent.

The portfolio is still losing purchasing power despite the addition of growth assets. We would need to liabilities to be less than the growth assets





Not sure why this has been playing in my head recently, but here we are. I will start from the broad concepts and work down to the details. I will use contract-like language in the sense that defined terms will be capitalized throughout this article.

Assets are things you have that could be converted into cash (also known as liquidating). Liabilities are things you have that oblige you to repay. Net Worth is the result of taking the sum of the value of all your assets and subtracting the sum of the value of all your Liabilities.

Standard bookkeeping.

When discussing Portfolios, we typically speak only about Assets, our Asset Portfolio. As I've been learning more about finances, I've included Liabilities when I talk about my Portfolio. I've done so partly because I don't want to change what's included in my Net Worth calculations. By having both Assets and Liabilities be part of my Portfolio, I can give each Targets and Bands for each in my Portfolio. Further, if I were to use Liabilities to purchase one or more Assets, I get feedback from the portfolio.

Suppose I add the total of my Liabilities (as a positive number) to the total value of my Assets; this gives me the total value of the Portfolio. In that case, I can use it as the denominator to calculate the percentage each occupies in my Portfolio. Total Liabilities divided by the Portfolio's total (positive) value gives us the percentage Liabilities occupy. Total Assets divided by the Portfolio's total (positive) value gives us the percentage our Assets occupy.

For example, let's say I have 40,000 USD of value in a retirement account and another 5,000 USD in cash; I have a total of 45,000 USD in Assets. Now, let's say I have a car loan of 5,000 [.United States Dollars](USD) and a student loan of 50,000 USD; I have a total of 55,000 USD in Liabilities. From here, we can get 3 different numbers:

1. Net Worth: `45,000 - 55,000 = -10,000`
2. Assets as a percent: `45,000 / (45,000 + 55,000) = 0.45 (or 45 percent)`
3. Liabilities as a percent: `55,000 / (45,000 + 55,000) = 0.55 (or 55 percent)`

If my Net Worth is negative, I know my Liabilities are outpacing my Assets without any further calculations. That's one of the things that makes Net Worth powerful from a feedback perspective. With that said, these three numbers combined form an informational foundation to set goals (Targets) and make changes.

A Target is the ideal percentage of the portfolio for a given segment. A Band is a deviation from the Target we're okay with.

Generally speaking, we want Liabilities to occupy a smaller percentage than our Assets, thereby resulting in a positive Net Worth. If someone came along and wanted to call in our debt (Liabilities), we might still have money left over after selling our Assets.

In investing terms, we would say "margin" for taking on a Liability to purchase some Asset. We would say "margin call" when the person or organization who gave us the money demanded it back.

My ideal (Target) for Liabilities is 0 percent. Therefore, my ideal (Target) for Assets is 100 percent. With that said, I like to eat, have a place to live, and so on, all of which either are Liabilities in themselves or have Liabilities associated with them through their [total cost of ownership](/essays-and-editorials/finances/total-cost-of-ownership/).

0 percent Liabilities is impossible to maintain day-to-day. Therefore, I want to set bands for myself. I find it easiest to start where you are. Let's go back to the example of the person with 45 percent Assets and 55 percent Liabilities. This isn't about judgment and criticism; it's meeting ourselves where we are so we can move to where we want to be.

In terms of Bands, I typically set 4. There's a maximum, a high, a low, and a minimum. For this person, maybe they start with:

- maximum 55 percent,
- high of 50 percent,
- a Target of 45, 
- low of 40, and
- minimum of 35.

The next step is to see if I can get my actual percentage to match the Target. When it does, maybe I move the Target down a bit, keeping the same distance from the Target for the Bands, like the following:

- Maximum 50 percent,
- high of 45 percent,
- a new Target of 40, 
- low of 35, and
- minimum of 30.

In this sense, the Target and Bands become the [guideline and guardrails](/essays-and-editorials/guidelines-and-guardrails/), respectively.

Because Assets aren't typically correlated with one another, we could say we have a diversified Portfolio.

Let's break Assets and Liabilities down into segments as well.

## Breaking down Assets

I've come to recognize 4 segments of Assets:

1. Liquid: 
	1. These are Assets that are easily exchanged for products, services, and repaying Liabilities. 
	2. These Assets typically have a real rate of return less than inflation; the quantity and quality of products and services you can purchase diminish over time.
	3. They may have a holding period of up to 1 year.
2. Growth: 
	1. These are Assets that aren't easily exchanged for products, services, and repaying Liabilities. 
	2. These Assets have a historical real rate of return greater than inflation; that's why we call them Growth Assets. 
	3. We're not talking about growth in terms of style boxes for equities, which are a specific type of Growth Asset.
	4. The value of these Assets tends to fluctuate day-to-day. However, over the course of decades, their value tends to increase.
3. Negative Correlation: 
	1. These are Assets that aren't easily exchanged for products, services, and repaying Liabilities.
	2. The historical real rate of return for these Assets is less important than their value.
	3. The value of these Assets tends to fluctuate less day-to-day than Growth Assets, and the value or income generated tends to increase when the value of Growth Assets decreases.
	4. These Assets also tend to have a low or negative correlation with Liquid Assets.
4. Low Correlation:
	1. These are Assets that aren't easily exchanged for products, services, and repaying Liabilities.
	2. The value of these Assets may fluctuate daily compared to Growth Assets. However, they typically fluctuate for different reasons; this is what gives them a low correlation to Growth Assets specifically and all three of the others generally.

It's important to note and reiterate; we're not talking about specific types of Assets. We are talking about the characteristics of Assets. These four segments of Assets likely exist if an economy is at play.

Thinking back to old prison and war movies where cigarettes and matches could be traded for products and services. In that context, they were a Liquid Asset. In another context, they might be considered a Liability.

Further, if you are operating within an economy, you have a Portfolio consisting of Assets and Liabilities. Specifically Liquid Assets, like your time and labor.

When we talk about historical returns, in most cases, we're talking in terms of decades. I'll give some examples in the United States for each segment, as of this writing, based on the characteristic of the Asset:

1. Liquid: 
	1. The United States Dollar, also known as cash.
	2. [.Certificates of Deposit](CDs) or Share Certificates with a maturity date of one year or less.
	3. Government and Corporate Bonds with a one-year or less maturity date.
2. Growth: Shares in corporations, also known as equities.
3. Negative Correlation: Long-Term United States Treasury Bonds.
4. Low Correlation: Gold and other commodities.

I intentionally gave more for the Liquid Asset segment so I could say the following. There may come a time when these things change. The characteristics of Share Certificates, for example, may hit a point where their historical real rate of return and other characteristics causes them to move to Low Correlation instead of Liquid. The same could be said for gold, possibly moving to something more Liquid-like.

When I talk about the allocation of the Asset Portfolio, these are the segments I use. When I design systems, I look to have three qualities:

1. self-maintaining,
2. self-cleansing, and
3. the ability to opt-in to complexity.

For years my Asset Portfolio was completely Liquid. My Liabilities outweighed my Assets by a lot. If I did the calculations, I would have been 60 percent Liabilities and 40 percent Assets. And that 40 percent was all Liquid Assets. Then I started contributing to my employer's 401k plan. I was purchasing Growth Assets in the form of shares in indexed mutual funds, opting into more complexity. 

I set myself Targets and Bands for how much I wanted in Liquid Assets and how much I wanted in Growth Assets. In December 2020, my Liabilities hit 0 for the first time in almost 20 years, and I set the Target for Liabilities to 0 percent with a high Band of 0.5 percent and a maximum band of 1 percent. I may purchase something with a loan in the future, and the high and maximum Bands may change. But, for now, this works.

I also set Targets and Bands for Liquid and Growth in my Asset Portfolio. 

Returning to the self-maintaining concept, I set milestone events to change the allocation and increase complexity. When the Asset Portfolio hits a certain value, I'll add in Negative Correlation assets. The Portfolio is a ways off from that point. Therefore, I'm not committing myself to a specific Asset because I don't know what Assets will fall into that category when it hits that milestone. Still, I know what characteristics I'll look for when it does.
