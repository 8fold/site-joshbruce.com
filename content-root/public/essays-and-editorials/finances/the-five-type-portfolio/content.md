# Net worth and portfolios

{!! dateblock !!}

Assertions:

1. Everyone has a portfolio.
2. Every portfolio has 5 types or categories.
3. Each type is based on characteristics, not the thing itself.
4. The things may move between types based on historical performance.

The 5 types are:

1. Liabilities and expenses.
2. Short-term and income (assets).
3. Growth assets.
4. Negative correlation assets.
5. Low correlation assets.

## Liabilities and expenses 

Standard bookkeeping definitions apply when it comes to characteristics for things we’d say are this type, specifically:

1. A negative or neutral real rate of return.
2. Interest rates are in terms of [.Annual Percentage Rate](APR) and indicate excess money given to someone else.

When we say real rate of return we’re talking about annual yields less inflation. 

I have a utility bill I pay each month (an expense). When inflation is a positive percent, we say we’re in an inflationary environment. When inflation is negative, we say we’re in a deflationary environment. In an inflationary environment, my utility bill will most likely increase over time for the same amount of use. In a deflationary environment, my utility bill may decrease for the same amount of use.

Let’s try a different example.

Let’s say I have a car loan. The APR is 6 percent; this is a negative percent because it’s what I owe on top of the original balance of the loan. Let’s say inflation is 4 percent. This loan has a real rate of return of negative 10 percent.

Now, let’s say we’re in a deflationary environment and inflation is negative 7 percent. The auto loan now has a real rate of return of 1 percent. I realize this may sound odd, but it’s possibly. Not likely, but possible. More likely would be a deflationary period with higher interest rates on the loan.

Again, what qualifies a thing to fall into this type is that the real rate of return is negative or near 0.

## Short-term and income (assets)

Short-term and income (assets) are characterized by:

1. Will be exchanged within 12 to 84 months.
2. Historically have exhibited a low (often negative) real rate of return.
3. Things of this type can typically be easily be exchanged for products and services.
4. Interest rates are in terms of [.Annual Percentage Yield](APY) and indicate excess money given to you.

By historically we’re talking in terms of a decade or more. I tend to look at things in terms of 10, 20, 30, and 40 years.

It’s possible that something can move between types. Moving between types is often a slow process. Because it’s often a slow process is why we look at historical data in terms of decades; often giving more weight the recent period.

The most universal falling into this type is cash. 

It’s important to note that cash isn’t the only thing with these characteristics. Short-term treasury bills in the [.United States](US) would also fit this type. A regular savings account at a financial institution. A share certificate or certificate of deposit.

Let’s go for an example.

You have a dollar (or whatever the equivalent name is in your economy). If inflation is 1 percent, the dollar has a real rate of return of negative 1 percent, and you are in an inflationary environment. If inflation is negative 1 percent, the dollar has a real rate of return of 1 percent, and you are in a deflationary environment. Historically, there are more inflationary years than deflationary years.

So, when we look at things in terms of decades, we would need to have a decade (or longer) of positive real rates of return before we would move something like cash to a different type in our portfolio. 

The historical precedent being a negative real rate of return for things of this type is one reason many in the finance space advise against leaving cash under your mattress “doing nothing.” Instead, we want to put our dollars to work, either by paying for liabilities or buying other things in other categories.

Let’s say you have a dollar in a savings account. The savings account has an APY of 1 percent. Let’s say we’re in an inflationary environment, and inflation is 3 percent. The real rate of return of the dollar is negative 2 percent. If we were in a deflationary environment, say negative 3 percent, the real rate of return for the dollar would be 4 percent.

## The portfolio everyone has

If you participate in any style of economy your portfolio will have the previous two types.

Products and services you’re spending money on and the money you are holding or using to pay for the products and services.

Because we have more than 1 type, we can create a portfolio allocation.

We want to establish [guidelines and guardrails](/essays-and-editorials/guidelines-and-guardrails/) for each type compared to the total of the portfolio.

In this context the guideline is a target for the type. You may also have 2 to 4 guardrails. If we only do 2, they will establish a minimum and a maximum. If we use 4, there will be minimum, low, high, and maximum. Then we want to consider, and preferably capture, what will happen if the proportion of the type goes below the low or medium, and above the high or maximum.

For most of us, we want our liabilities to be a low proportion and our other assets to be higher. I recommend starting from where you are.

1. Take all the balances of your liabilities and add them together. (Optionally, you could include regular bills as well.)
2. Add up the current value of all your short-term assets.
3. Add those two numbers together; to get the total portfolio balance.
4. Divide the balance of your liabilities by the total portfolio balance to get the proportion of your liabilities.
5. Divide the value of your short-term assets by the total portfolio balance to get the proportion of your short-term assets.
6. Subtract you liabilities from you short-term assets to get your net worth (presuming your portfolio only has these two types).

When I graduated university I had:

1. about 126,000 [.United States Dollars](USD) in liabilities, and 
2. about 1,000 USD in short-term assets. 
3. My total portfolio balance was 127,000.
4. My liabilities occupied 99 percent of the portfolio.
5. My short-term assets occupied the remaining 1 percent.
6. My net worth was negative 125,000 USD.

If I would have done this exercise back then I probably would have had a panic attack, curled into a ball for a while, and cried a lot. (Instead, I suffered through depression for about three years straight despite not doing this exercise. I also buried my head in the sand when it came to my money.)

If present-me were in that situation and did this exercise, I think I could handle it much better.

I know the current state of the universe. I know I don’t want that to continue being the state of the universe.

I’d start by setting the guidelines and guardrails for the liabilities. 99 percent would be the maximum. 89 percent would be high. 79 percent would be the target. 0 would be the low and minimum.

While I’d like my liabilities to be lower than 79 percent, I don’t do well with super audacious goals. So, once I hit the 79 percent mark, maybe I’d set that to be the high or maximum and calibrate the other 2 accordingly.

For short-term assets, I would have set the minimum to be 1 percent (where I was), the low to be 3, the target to be 6, the high to be 8, and the maximum to be 9.

With this perspective, it’s still a numbers game, and still somewhat overwhelming. However, it can be psychologically less daunting. Instead of trying to move a needle over 100,000 USD while making 20,000 USD per year, I’m just trying to move a percentage point or two.

I might also start looking at the next type in our portfolio.

## Growth assets

Growth assets are characterized by:

1. Not sure when or if you’ll need to convert them to short-term assets.
2. Historically have exhibited a positive (or high) real rate of return compared to other options.
3. Things of this type typically aren’t easily exchanged directly for products and services.
4. Interest rates are in terms of [.Annual Percentage Yield](APY) and indicate excess money given to you.

In the United States the most well known are equities; also known as shares in [.United States](US) companies. According to [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/710711/return-on-equities-bonds-bills-usa/), the real rate of return for US equities from 2002 to 2019 was 7 percent per year. 

For comparison, the real rate of return for my regular savings account (short-term assets) was around negative 2 percent.

Two things I want to make sure of here:

1. The rate of return includes dividends paid to shareholders and appreciation of the share value; also known as resell value or Capital appreciation.
2. Growth assets as a type can be a bit confusing because there is a specific style of equity called growth, that’s not what we’re talking about.

Typically, when you buy growth assets you are exchanging your short-term assets for a different asset. In the case of US equities, you exchange for a share in the company. In the case of mutual funds, you’re buying a share in the fund; in turn the custodian of the fund buys individual equities.

Further, one of the things that makes growth assets what they are is [the risk premium](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskpremium.asp). The risk premium is the excess return compared to the risk free rate return. Risk is different than volatility. Risk refers to the possibility of loss. Volatility refers to the swings of value for the asset. They are related, but not the same.

Let’s go back to our example portfolio:

- Liabilities: minimum and low of 0, target of 79, high of 89, and a maximum of 99 percent. Current percent of 99.
- Short-term assets: minimum of 1, low of 3, target of 6, high of 8, and maximum of 9. Current percent of 1.

If I were to add growth assets, I’d look at the targets and get them to add to 100 percent:

- Liabilities: 79 percent.
- Short-term assets: 6 percent.
- Growth assets: 15 percent. The minimum I would have set at that time would have been 0. A low of 5 percent. A high of 20, and maximum of 25 percent.









Not sure why this has been playing in my head recently, but here we are. I will start from the broad concepts and work down to the details. I will use contract-like language in the sense that defined terms will be capitalized throughout this article.

Assets are things you have that could be converted into cash (also known as liquidating). Liabilities are things you have that oblige you to repay. Net Worth is the result of taking the sum of the value of all your assets and subtracting the sum of the value of all your Liabilities.

Standard bookkeeping.

When discussing Portfolios, we typically speak only about Assets, our Asset Portfolio. As I've been learning more about finances, I've included Liabilities when I talk about my Portfolio. I've done so partly because I don't want to change what's included in my Net Worth calculations. By having both Assets and Liabilities be part of my Portfolio, I can give each Targets and Bands for each in my Portfolio. Further, if I were to use Liabilities to purchase one or more Assets, I get feedback from the portfolio.

Suppose I add the total of my Liabilities (as a positive number) to the total value of my Assets; this gives me the total value of the Portfolio. In that case, I can use it as the denominator to calculate the percentage each occupies in my Portfolio. Total Liabilities divided by the Portfolio's total (positive) value gives us the percentage Liabilities occupy. Total Assets divided by the Portfolio's total (positive) value gives us the percentage our Assets occupy.

For example, let's say I have 40,000 USD of value in a retirement account and another 5,000 USD in cash; I have a total of 45,000 USD in Assets. Now, let's say I have a car loan of 5,000 [.United States Dollars](USD) and a student loan of 50,000 USD; I have a total of 55,000 USD in Liabilities. From here, we can get 3 different numbers:

1. Net Worth: `45,000 - 55,000 = -10,000`
2. Assets as a percent: `45,000 / (45,000 + 55,000) = 0.45 (or 45 percent)`
3. Liabilities as a percent: `55,000 / (45,000 + 55,000) = 0.55 (or 55 percent)`

If my Net Worth is negative, I know my Liabilities are outpacing my Assets without any further calculations. That's one of the things that makes Net Worth powerful from a feedback perspective. With that said, these three numbers combined form an informational foundation to set goals (Targets) and make changes.

A Target is the ideal percentage of the portfolio for a given segment. A Band is a deviation from the Target we're okay with.

Generally speaking, we want Liabilities to occupy a smaller percentage than our Assets, thereby resulting in a positive Net Worth. If someone came along and wanted to call in our debt (Liabilities), we might still have money left over after selling our Assets.

In investing terms, we would say "margin" for taking on a Liability to purchase some Asset. We would say "margin call" when the person or organization who gave us the money demanded it back.

My ideal (Target) for Liabilities is 0 percent. Therefore, my ideal (Target) for Assets is 100 percent. With that said, I like to eat, have a place to live, and so on, all of which either are Liabilities in themselves or have Liabilities associated with them through their [total cost of ownership](/essays-and-editorials/finances/total-cost-of-ownership/).

0 percent Liabilities is impossible to maintain day-to-day. Therefore, I want to set bands for myself. I find it easiest to start where you are. Let's go back to the example of the person with 45 percent Assets and 55 percent Liabilities. This isn't about judgment and criticism; it's meeting ourselves where we are so we can move to where we want to be.

In terms of Bands, I typically set 4. There's a maximum, a high, a low, and a minimum. For this person, maybe they start with:

- maximum 55 percent,
- high of 50 percent,
- a Target of 45, 
- low of 40, and
- minimum of 35.

The next step is to see if I can get my actual percentage to match the Target. When it does, maybe I move the Target down a bit, keeping the same distance from the Target for the Bands, like the following:

- Maximum 50 percent,
- high of 45 percent,
- a new Target of 40, 
- low of 35, and
- minimum of 30.

In this sense, the Target and Bands become the [guideline and guardrails](/essays-and-editorials/guidelines-and-guardrails/), respectively.

Because Assets aren't typically correlated with one another, we could say we have a diversified Portfolio.

Let's break Assets and Liabilities down into segments as well.

## Breaking down Assets

I've come to recognize 4 segments of Assets:

1. Liquid: 
	1. These are Assets that are easily exchanged for products, services, and repaying Liabilities. 
	2. These Assets typically have a real rate of return less than inflation; the quantity and quality of products and services you can purchase diminish over time.
	3. They may have a holding period of up to 1 year.
2. Growth: 
	1. These are Assets that aren't easily exchanged for products, services, and repaying Liabilities. 
	2. These Assets have a historical real rate of return greater than inflation; that's why we call them Growth Assets. 
	3. We're not talking about growth in terms of style boxes for equities, which are a specific type of Growth Asset.
	4. The value of these Assets tends to fluctuate day-to-day. However, over the course of decades, their value tends to increase.
3. Negative Correlation: 
	1. These are Assets that aren't easily exchanged for products, services, and repaying Liabilities.
	2. The historical real rate of return for these Assets is less important than their value.
	3. The value of these Assets tends to fluctuate less day-to-day than Growth Assets, and the value or income generated tends to increase when the value of Growth Assets decreases.
	4. These Assets also tend to have a low or negative correlation with Liquid Assets.
4. Low Correlation:
	1. These are Assets that aren't easily exchanged for products, services, and repaying Liabilities.
	2. The value of these Assets may fluctuate daily compared to Growth Assets. However, they typically fluctuate for different reasons; this is what gives them a low correlation to Growth Assets specifically and all three of the others generally.

It's important to note and reiterate; we're not talking about specific types of Assets. We are talking about the characteristics of Assets. These four segments of Assets likely exist if an economy is at play.

Thinking back to old prison and war movies where cigarettes and matches could be traded for products and services. In that context, they were a Liquid Asset. In another context, they might be considered a Liability.

Further, if you are operating within an economy, you have a Portfolio consisting of Assets and Liabilities. Specifically Liquid Assets, like your time and labor.

When we talk about historical returns, in most cases, we're talking in terms of decades. I'll give some examples in the United States for each segment, as of this writing, based on the characteristic of the Asset:

1. Liquid: 
	1. The United States Dollar, also known as cash.
	2. [.Certificates of Deposit](CDs) or Share Certificates with a maturity date of one year or less.
	3. Government and Corporate Bonds with a one-year or less maturity date.
2. Growth: Shares in corporations, also known as equities.
3. Negative Correlation: Long-Term United States Treasury Bonds.
4. Low Correlation: Gold and other commodities.

I intentionally gave more for the Liquid Asset segment so I could say the following. There may come a time when these things change. The characteristics of Share Certificates, for example, may hit a point where their historical real rate of return and other characteristics causes them to move to Low Correlation instead of Liquid. The same could be said for gold, possibly moving to something more Liquid-like.

When I talk about the allocation of the Asset Portfolio, these are the segments I use. When I design systems, I look to have three qualities:

1. self-maintaining,
2. self-cleansing, and
3. the ability to opt-in to complexity.

For years my Asset Portfolio was completely Liquid. My Liabilities outweighed my Assets by a lot. If I did the calculations, I would have been 60 percent Liabilities and 40 percent Assets. And that 40 percent was all Liquid Assets. Then I started contributing to my employer's 401k plan. I was purchasing Growth Assets in the form of shares in indexed mutual funds, opting into more complexity. 

I set myself Targets and Bands for how much I wanted in Liquid Assets and how much I wanted in Growth Assets. In December 2020, my Liabilities hit 0 for the first time in almost 20 years, and I set the Target for Liabilities to 0 percent with a high Band of 0.5 percent and a maximum band of 1 percent. I may purchase something with a loan in the future, and the high and maximum Bands may change. But, for now, this works.

I also set Targets and Bands for Liquid and Growth in my Asset Portfolio. 

Returning to the self-maintaining concept, I set milestone events to change the allocation and increase complexity. When the Asset Portfolio hits a certain value, I'll add in Negative Correlation assets. The Portfolio is a ways off from that point. Therefore, I'm not committing myself to a specific Asset because I don't know what Assets will fall into that category when it hits that milestone. Still, I know what characteristics I'll look for when it does.

## Breaking down Liabilities
