# The universal portfolio

{!! dateblock !!}

Not to be confused with [Cover's Universal Portfolio Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_portfolio_algorithm). Or something like [The Ultimate Buy and Hold Portfolio](https://paulmerriman.com/ultimate-buy-and-hold-strategy/). This is not an allocation or management strategy. Instead, it's a model for conceptualizing, tracking, and making decisions (executing a management strategy).

Assertions:

1. Everyone has a portfolio.
2. Every portfolio has 5 categories.
3. Each category can grow and shrink independently.
4. Each category is based on characteristics, not the things inside.
5. Things may move between categories based on historical performance.

The first 2 assertions are why it's called The Universal Portfolio.

The Universal Portfolio is based on Permanent Accounts and the Net Worth Calculation. For the uninitiated, that means means Assets and Liabilities and the following calculation:

```
Assets - Liabilities = Net Worth
```

We'll do this in 3 rounds with 3 asides to help define some terms.

The first aside is that by "historical" in this context, we're talking in terms of decades; 10, 20, 30, 40, and so on years. Further, we'll intentionally inject a recency bias, giving more weight to recent time scales. We do this to avoid reversion to a mean, accommodate the complex adaptive nature of financial systems, and see paradigm shifts early.

The first round lists the categories. The second round outlines the primary characteristics of things in each category. The third round lists items that have fallen into each category historically.

## The categories (round 1)

The first round is brief. We'll list the 5 categories:

1. Liabilities and outflows,
2. short-term assets and inflows,
3. growth assets,
4. negative correlation assets, and
5. low correlation assets.

## The characteristics (round 2)

We're going to get the other 2 asides out of the way.

The second aside is around the "real rate." We adjust the interest rate by the inflation rate. For liabilities, we use a positive number for the interest rate, add the inflation rate, and convert the sum to a negative number. For assets, we use a positive number for the interest rate and subtract the inflation rate, leaving us with the real rate.

A bill is an outflow. It has a 0 percent interest rate. Inflation is 3 percent, and the sum is 3, giving us a negative 3 when we're done. A credit card is a liability. It has a 20 percent interest rate, inflation is 3 percent, and the sum is 23 percent, giving us a negative 23 when we're done. A savings account is a short-term asset. It has a 3 percent interest rate. Inflation is 3 percent, leaving us with 0 as the real rate.

The final aside is more in-depth.

This is a derivative of [The Holy Grail of Investing](/essays-and-editorials/finances/concepts/#the-three-principles-of-investing). However, the result is similar. We'll end up with 4 quadrants. The horizontal axis goes from infinite deflation (left) to infinite inflation (right); in percent. The vertical axis goes from infinite growth (top) to infinite contraction (bottom). At any given time, the market you are [saving and investing](/essays-and-editorials/finances/concepts/#saving-isnt-investing) in is in one of the 4 quadrants, and you are operating in a market in one of the 4 quadrants. You can save and invest in a market different from the one you are operating in. The 4 quadrants are as follows:

1. deflationary-growth,
2. inflationary-growth (2021, for example),
3. deflationary-contracting, and
4. inflationary-contracting (2022, for example).

A market can be at equilibrium, represented by the point where the scales cross. Historically, different types of holdings are more favorable in different environments.

On to the primary characteristics of each category.

### Liabilities and outflows (characteristics)

1. Things you owe or give to others.
2. The real rate is the lowest (often negative) compared to the other categories.
3. Historically, they are more favorable in all but deflationary-contracting environments.

It's worth a couple of clarifications and examples.

Typically, in finances, we don't think of liabilities and outflows in terms of the real rate. There are two reasons we did it in The Universal Portfolio context. First, it reduces cognitive load; if I'm thinking of every category in terms of the real rate, I don't need to shift mentally—*if this* is a liability, *then* I don't use the real rate. Second, using the real rate can help increase the psychological impact when looking for "high-interest debt."

Next is that, in finances, we typically don't think of liabilities and outflows as favorable in any given economic environment. With that said, if you are in a growing economy, chances are interest rates will be low on loans. If you're in an inflationary economy, buying something now is "buying low" because prices are increasing. So, while these things aren't bringing in more money in a deflationary contracting environment, they're always going out and are costing less.

In contracting times, interest rates tend to increase. As a result, it costs more to borrow money; therefore, liabilities are less favorable.

Further, let's say a pack of chewing gum lasts you a year. At present, the cost of a pack of chewing is 1 [.United States Dollar](USD). The inflation rate for the last 10 years in the economy in which you are operating has been 7 percent. If the next 10 years are anything like the previous 10, that pack of gum will be 2 USD. If you have an extra 100 USD sitting around and buy 100 packs of gum, and the next 10 years are like the last 10 years, you have "bought low." If the next 10 years are deflationary at the same rate (only negative), then a pack of gum becomes 0.50 USD. You actually "bought high"; less favorable.

The last 4 categories will be much shorter.

### Short-term assets and inflows (characteristics)

1. Things you have or receive.
2. The historical real rate has been relatively neutral compared to the other categories.
3. Historically, they are more favorable in deflationary environments.

### Growth assets (characteristics)

1. Things you have or receive.
2. The historical real rate has been the highest compared to all the categories.
3. Historically, they are more favorable in growth environments (hence the name).

When we use the term "growth," we're not talking about [style boxes for equities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equity_stylebox.asp). Instead, we are talking about a favorable environment.

### Negative correlation assets (characteristics)

We're going to change up the second characteristic for this one.

1. Things you have or receive.
2. Has the lowest (usually negative) historical correlation with growth assets.
3. Historically, they are more favorable in contracting environments, making them negatively correlated with growth assets.

### Low correlation assets (characteristics)

Watch that second characteristic again.

1. Things you have or receive.
2. Has low historical correlation with things in all other categories.
3. Historically, they are more favorable in inflationary environments.

By low correlation, we mean the correlation may be negative, just not as negative as the negative correlation assets, or the correlation may be positive but less than 60–80 percent.

## The types (round 3)

We're going to focus on the "elephants in the room." And we're only talking about as of this writing.

### Liabilities and outflows (types)

1. Bills, charitable giving, and time.
2. Terminal loans (auto, mortgage, student, and so on).
3. Revolving loans (credit cards, lines of credit, and so on).

### Short-term assets and inflows (types)

1. Your paycheck and time.
2. Cash.
3. Things with a maturity date of fewer than 10 years (certificates of deposit and share certificates, I-bonds, short-term treasuries, and so on).

The lists for the other types will get shorter because they have the biggest elephants.

### Growth assets (types)

United States equities.

### Negative correlation assets (types)

Long-term United States Treasuries.

### Low correlation assets (types)

This one has two elephants. We'll call them a parent and child. But, it's one of those instances where the child is larger than the parent.

The parent is what we typically call commodities in general, and the child is gold specifically.

## Why, though?

With the meat and potatoes (or dessert if you remember the original presentation) out of the way, let's talk about what this model gives us.

Why not just do it the way everyone else does?

In short, because I was reconciling the "shoulds" and "buts," I was hearing from the various [life and financial content I was consuming](https://joshbruce.com/examinations/):

- You should have an emergency fund that covers your insurance deductibles, and it should be in cash (short-term asset); but
- you should also reduce your high-interest rate debt (liabilities) and expenses (outflows); but
- you should also build a cash reserve of at least 3 months of living expenses, and it should be in cash (short-term asset); but
- you should be in the market (growth assets) and not have cash  (short-term asset) sitting on the sidelines; but
- you should consider risk by having a stock-bond portfolio (negative correlation and growth assets); but
- not all bonds are created equal (short-term, negative correlation, and low correlation);
- and on.

These are a lot of [guidelines and guardrails](/essays-and-editorials/guidelines-and-guardrails/), and it's not even a complete list.

So I wanted a model that could accommodate all the "buts" and "shoulds" and different ways people do things with their finances—investing on margin (liability), cash-only (short-term), accumulation (short-term and growth), buy the dip (short-term and growth without negative or low correlation), and so on.

Let's look at some other primary considerations. 

### Transparency

The way many of us talk about finances allows us to, for lack of a better term, hide things and not say anything. Talking money in the United States is pretty taboo, and the way we usually talk about finance, in particular, allows us to say something without saying anything:

> I have a net worth of 500,000 USD, and my portfolio is 100 percent in a total stock market index fund.

On the surface, we could presume all sorts of things.

This person has a total stock market fund valued at 500,000 USD, and every time they get paid, the money goes straight into it, and they cashflow their lifestyle from selling shares. Not saying it's terrible if you do that. But I could presume that's what's happening.

This person has no debt. This person has whatever. Again, it's saying something without saying anything. For the sake of closing out the example, let's put their financial situation into The Universal Portfolio model:

1. Liabilities and outflows: They have a mortgage with a 200,000 USD balance.
2. Short-term assets and inflows: They have 100,000 USD in cash to cover deductibles and 12 months of living expenses.
3. Growth assets: They have a total stock market fund valued at 100,000 USD.
4. Negative correlation assets: None.
5. Low correlation assets: They have a house they paid 500,000 USD for.

Assets of 700,000 USD minus liabilities of 200,000 USD is a net worth of 500,000 USD. So now let's examine the part about "my portfolio is 100 percent in a total stock market index fund."

If by "portfolio," we mean everything excluding cash and liabilities (the mortgage) and use assets (the house), absolutely true. But that wouldn't be in Univeral Portfolio terms.

We have a portfolio with a total value of 900,000 USD:

1. Liabilities and outflows: Roughly 20 percent.
2. Short-term assets and inflows: Roughly 15 percent.
3. Growth assets: Roughly 15 percent.
4. Negative correlation: 0 percent.
5. Low correlation: Roughly 50 percent.

Transparent.

### Multiple asset types

Traditionally we look at portfolios in terms of growth assets (stocks) and non-cash assets (bonds). 

One of the "shoulds" in the financial community is that you *should* be all stocks during accumulation mode. Further, another "should" is that you *should* rebalance your portfolio regularly. Finally, you *should* buy low and sell high (buy the dips).

That said, there is no rebalancing if your "portfolio" only has one index fund. The Universal Portfolio changes that. Let's use our example portfolio from above.

1. Liabilities and outflows: Roughly 20 percent.
2. Short-term assets and inflows: Roughly 15 percent.
3. Growth assets: Roughly 15 percent.
4. Negative correlation: 0 percent.
5. Low correlation: Roughly 50 percent.

Let's say the growth assets drop by 20 percent:

1. Liabilities and outflows: 200,000 USD.
2. Short-term assets and inflows: 100,000 USD.
3. Growth assets: 80,000 USD.
4. Negative correlation: 0 USD.
5. Low correlation: 500,000 USD.

The percents change to:

1. Liabilities and outflows: Roughly 23 percent.
2. Short-term assets and inflows: Roughly 11 percent.
3. Growth assets: Roughly 9 percent.
4. Negative correlation: 0 percent.
5. Low correlation: Roughly 57 percent.

Hypothetically part of your [investment policy](/essays-and-editorials/finances/investment-policies/) is you want to maintain the same percentage of short-term and growth assets. Further, if growth assets drop by a certain percentage, you can do some rebalancing (rebalancing on bands).

Then, in this circumstance, you can take 1 percent of your short-term assets and buy growth assets. 1 percent of 100,000 USD is 10,000 USD. Bringing us to:

1. Liabilities and outflows: 200,000 USD.
2. Short-term assets and inflows: 90,000 USD.
3. Growth assets: 90,000 USD.
4. Negative correlation: 0 USD.
5. Low correlation: 500,000 USD.

This brings us to the following percentages:

1. Liabilities and outflows: Roughly 23 percent.
2. Short-term assets and inflows: Roughly 10 percent.
3. Growth assets: Roughly 10 percent.
4. Negative correlation: 0 percent.
5. Low correlation: Roughly 57 percent.

Let's say growth assets have a severe spike, and you're still in accumulation mode. Let's say growth assets jump by 30 percent:

1. Liabilities and outflows: 200,000 USD.
2. Short-term assets and inflows: 90,000 USD.
3. Growth assets: 117,000 USD (90,000 USD + 27,000 USD).
4. Negative correlation: 0 USD.
5. Low correlation: 500,000 USD.

Now the value of the portfolio is 907,000 USD and the following percentages:

1. Liabilities and outflows: Roughly 22 percent.
2. Short-term assets and inflows: Roughly 10 percent.
3. Growth assets: Roughly 13 percent.
4. Negative correlation: 0 percent.
5. Low correlation: Roughly 55 percent.

Does that mean we should sell some growth assets?

Depends on the investment policy statement. You may be in accumulation mode and have as part of your statement not to sell other assets. Okay. You could stop throwing extra money at growth assets, keep it in a savings vehicle, or pay down the liabilities.

And, maybe your policy statement says go ahead and sell, but it's only half. To illustrate using our example, we'd need to trade 1.5 percent of our growth assets (roughly 2,000 USD) to get short-term and growth assets to be equal weights in the portfolio. Our policy statement would allow us to do 0.75 percent (roughly 875 USD).

With the traditional way of looking at a "portfolio," you may not see these opportunities.
