# Open source software

{!!dateblock!!}

There’s a difference between open source, libre, and free.

Let’s start with free, as in no charge. As the name suggests, you did not need to pay for the software. The [Reminders app](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reminders_(Apple)) from Apple, as of this writing, is free; however, it is neither libre nor open source.

Let’s jump to open source.

Open source has a common definition and a technical definition. At the most basic, open source just means the code the software uses is open to review; you can see how it works. The more technical definition is based on the license under which the software is distributed; [the criteria](https://en.m.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Open_Source_Definition) is governed by [The Open Source Initiative](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Source_Initiative). To be technically open source the software must use a license allowing for:

1. Free redistribution: You can sell or give away software that uses the open source software as a component without needing to pay a royalty fee to the creator of the open source component.
