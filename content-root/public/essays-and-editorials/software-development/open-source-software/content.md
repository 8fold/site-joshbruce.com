# Open source software

{!!dateblock!!}

There’s a difference between open source, libre, and free.

Let’s start with free, as in no charge. As the name suggests, you did not need to pay for the software. The [Reminders app](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reminders_(Apple)) from Apple, as of this writing, is free; however, it is neither libre nor open source.

Let’s jump to open source.

Open source, refers to the license under which a software application is distributed.
