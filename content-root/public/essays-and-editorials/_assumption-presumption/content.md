# Assumption, presumption, agreements, alliances, and orders

These are interesting words and ideas. In my experience we have a tendency to conflate some of them as if they mean the same thing. Let's start with the philosophical defining of terms; for our purposes, we'll use the Oxford English Dictionary, which captures the common use of these terms—dictionaries are not prescriptive, they are based on how we use language:

Assumption
:    a thing that is accepted as true or as certain to happen, without proof

Presumption
:    an idea that is taken to be true, and often used as the basis for other ideas, although it is not known for certain—an act or instance of taking something to be true or adopting a particular attitude toward something, especially at the start of a chain of argument or action

Agreement
:    harmony or accordance in opinion or feeling; a position or result of agreeing

Alliance
:    a union or association formed for mutual benefit, especially between countries or organizations

Order
:    an authoritative command, direction, or instruction

For the most part, we used the first, most common definition, however, when it cam to "order" the second definition was used as it is in keeping with the spirit of the others.

## Assumption and presumption

We make less assumptions than we might think, usually we are making presumptions.

I presume the sun will come out tomorrow. If I'm basing this position on the fact that the sun has come out on one or more previous days, I contend it is more presumption than assumption. It is not required to come true though.

I presume that if I jump off the ground, I will return to the ground shortly because that has been the case in the past; however, it may not be true, if I suddenly gain the ability to fly or if gravity ceases to function. I presume my heart will continue to beat. I presume I will continue to breathe.

Humans tend toward presumption, not assumption.

## Agreements and alliances

The difference here is that agreement doesn't explicitly mean to mutual benefit.

You and I can agree to destroy each other, for example. If we decide mutual destruction would be beneficial, then we could say we have an alliance.

I might think a certain behavior is bad; if you decide that behavior is also bad, we are in agreement. If, however, you don't believe that behavior is bad, then we are not in agreement. Further, if we both decide, for whatever reason, we wish to see less of that behavior and take actions to that end, then we have an alliance despite the fact we do not agree. 

It is possible to form alliances with people you do not agree with. Further, you can agree with some idea and decide not to form alliances with others.

There's also a point where things can get dicey—legalities. The term agreement is sometimes used in place of the word contract or alliance. You and I draw up some papers describing a joint course of action we plan to take on a certain subject. Even if we don't actually agree with each, we are entering into an agreement.

## Agreements and orders

Agreements are distinguishable from orders because agreements can be renegotiated whereas we typically view orders as *not* being renegotiable.

We often view militaries as operating on orders, not agreements between those in command and the commanded. 

Becca and I have a lot of agreements and alliances. There may be times where orders are needed, however, those times usually result from an agreement, alliance, or both. In some cases she may be considered an expert in the thing we are about to do, or, she may have more emotional connection to the task at hand; therefore, we might agree that she is in charge and, if something goes wrong, she won't necessarily hold it against me.

Maybe I'll come up with a better example in the future.

## Expectations

All of the above can lead to expectations of what will happen in the future; this expectation is risky.

Part of the risk is that the person with the expectation may suffer when their expectations aren't met. Further, the suffering may lead to the person with the unmet expectations lashing out on others. Finally, the person holding the expectation may treat it as a broken agreement or alliance.
