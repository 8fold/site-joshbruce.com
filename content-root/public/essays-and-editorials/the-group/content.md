# The group

{!! dateblock !!}

This is what can be described as the we-perspective.

The collective.

The collective has the same three questions as [the individual](/essays-and-editorials/the-self/):

1. Where did we come from?
2. Where are we going?
3. Why are we here?

Some groups come together based on their responses to the first two questions, which are still subjective; truth is not a democracy. Viewing it as such is a logical fallacy; appeal to popularity. And, yet, we use that as an argument all the time; seven billion people can't be wrong.

Anyway, right, pragmatism.

This area of the site is about relationship, connection, and interaction.

You and I are in a relationship. We are connecting. We may interact.

The fundamental position here though is that the group would not exist without the individual.

In the abstract, we are alone and together, always. We are alone in the sense that you are the only person who is with you 24 hours a day, seven days a week, every week of the year. (Even in the case of conjoined twins, they are not occupying the same mind and can be asleep at different times.) However, you are part of the group we call humans and, therefore, are never alone.

Woohoo! Paradox.

Exploring this paradox and these questions and ideas is what this area is all about.
