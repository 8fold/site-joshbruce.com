# Health and wellness

I wasn’t sure I’d ever create this section, but here we are.

The bottom line is that I don’t get sick or injured. Further, I have some baggage when it comes to the medical profession. Finally, I’m becoming injured but not sick, unsure if I should push or pause.

I’m a reasonably kinetic human. I’m fascinated by the human body moving through space. For years I’ve participated in what I call passive exercise. My desire for movement is unconventional.

Watching gymnastics was a favorite growing up. When I was introduced to [parkour](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkour) and [freerunning](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freerunning), I was fascinated.

I've moved the [year-by-year summaries](/experiences/health-and-wellness) to create consistency with other overview pages on the site, focusing on values, principles, practices, and tools. Further, this area will continue to evolve as the content is created and iterated concerning presentation.

## Values

1. Functional movement patterns over targeted training.
2. Movement efficiency over maxing out (reps, load, and so on).
3. Passive over active exercises. ("Active" means the primary purpose of the movements is to exercise, while "passive" means exercise is ancillary to another task or goal.)

## Principles

1. Efficiency of movements increases the longevity of movement.
	1. Speed hides inefficiencies.
	2. Momentum hides inefficiencies.

## Practices

1. If it hurts, don't do it.

## Tools

1. My body.
