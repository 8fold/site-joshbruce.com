# Health and wellness

{!! dateblock !!}

I wasn’t sure I’d ever create this section, but here we are.

Bottom line up front is that I don’t really get sick or injured. Further, I have some baggage when it comes to the medical profession. Finally, I’m now finding myself becoming injured, but not sick, and I’m not sure if I should push or pause.

I’m a fairly kinetic human. I’m fascinated by the human body moving through space. For years I’ve participated in what I call passive exercise. My desire for movement is unconventional.

Gymnastics was a favorite growing up. When I was introduced to [parkour](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkour) and [freerunning](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freerunning), I was fascinated.

We’ll go reverse chronological.

The plan is to stick with movements I can or could do, with links to in-depth explorations.

## 2023 (44 years of age)

I’ve been trying to become more active for a couple years. Every time I do, I’m laid up for a week or more.

- 1 inverted row a day for a way. 

The muscles in my back became so tense that it hurt to rotate my core, sit, or lift a jacket onto a hook. Urgent care prescribed steroids and a muscle relaxer. I was on them for a week and told not try an exercising. After two weeks it still felt like someone was pushing their thumb into my back when I would move in certain ways.

Prior to that I wanted to do the following every day:

- 1 one minute plank.
- 1 regular pushup.
- 1 inverted row.
- 1 air squat.

The regular pushup and plank caused my right great (big) toe to go apeshit. Swollen and anytime it was put into extension, it hurt like crazy. I could curl it pretty well. And walking was okay.

I could wear normal shoes. I could stand on it. All the “normal” things. But anytime it moved into extension, it sucked.

When the toe isn’t acting up, my passive exercising consists of walking up stairs by skipping a step; lunge. This stair movement happens multiple times a day as a smoke outside.

Every week I walk about 4 miles. Along with all the steps required to go outside and come back in.

## 2022 (43 years of age)

In the early part of the year I was contemplating active exercise movements and came down with appendicitis.

It took about 3 weeks to recover enough to only feel pain in extreme circumstances. I didn’t take the OxyContin that was prescribed, just the ibuprofen.

About this same or shortly after, my right big toe went nuts. Swelling and limited mobility. The hypothesis is that it’s gout. Took about a week to recover. 




In a way I’m a [sweet summer child](https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/sweet_summer_child).

The real hardships in my life have not been with health and wellness for almost 30 years. The running joke is I’m [Wolverine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverine_(character)) with excessive regenerative and recovery capabilities.

Now, I feel like I’m degrading quickly, and not sure I can rebound. I feel myself caught between pushing through and pausing until the doctors (plural) figure things out a bit.

Let’s talk in terms of movements.

Per day:

- 1 minute plank, could barely hold it for the whole minute 
- 1 pushup, very slow goings.

While I was able to complete these movements, my right great (big) toe went apeshit, and I couldn’t move my toe into dorsiflexion for a week; [hallux limitus](https://youtu.be/bovAPQtRZmU) with additional inflammation. I could still walk and curl, just no dorsiflexion for me.

This was the third event like this. Primary care thinks it’s gout. [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/arthritis/basics/gout.html#diagnose) says there’s only one way to confirm. Orthopedic surgeon confirmed there’s only one way to confirm, and they also think it’s gout; when asked if he wanted me to induce a flare so we could confirm, he said no.

Meanwhile, I figured I’d try another movement that I’ve done in the past:

- 1 inverted row per day.

I was feeling pretty good and decided to increase to 4 per day after the first two days.

This was, apparently, a mistake.











By the end of the week my back was nuts. I know what delayed-onset-muscle-soreness feels like for me, and this wasn’t it. My cervical and thoracic spine felt like someone was using pressure points every time I moved.







Urgent care prescribed steroids and muscle relaxers; that was a first for me.

Went the sports chiropractor I asked to join the pit crew. He recommended scapula push-ups while standing; what my doctor called an air pushup. 

Was feeling pretty good about those and did 10 a day for a couple days.

The pain in my back started coming back, so I stopped. (Feels like pissed off rhomboids.) To give you an idea, lifting my jacket onto a coat hook felt like some was digging their thumb into my back where my left scapula is.

And more.

So, there it is. I try doing movements outside of my literal day-to-day, and my body takes a week to recover. Sometimes the recovery includes medication.












Meanwhile I have an [.Magnetic Resonance Imaging](MRI) appointment set up for my foot and my cervical spine.






I went to an urgent care facility. They asked a ton of questions before asking me to move in certain ways and push against resistance in various directions.

I was prescribed steroids and muscle relaxers for the first time in my life.

I was told that the steroids would basically keep me awake and the muscle relaxer would put me to sleep. I went home and took the first day dose of both and went straight to sleep. The next day I took the day two dose and had a normal day. And so it went for the rest of the week.

So, now I’m afraid to do push-ups, planks, and inverted rows.

Admittedly I differentiate fear and terrified. The scale from least to most for me is not at all, disconcerted, fear, then terrified. 

The sports chiropractor I started seeing did a great job on our first visit, so I made a second visit to see what they thought. Didn’t do anything major on that visit.
