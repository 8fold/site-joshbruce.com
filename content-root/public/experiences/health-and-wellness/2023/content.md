## May

I had an [.Magnetic Resonance Imaging](MRI) done on my right foot. The follow-up appointment with the orthopedic surgeon went well. I appreciate that he essentially said, “I don’t know. And that’s not to say it isn’t happening.” He added that I should stop taking the uric acid reduction therapy as he didn’t see any indication of arthritis or uric acid crystals.

That same week I visited a physical therapist who seems amazing so far.

We looked at my walking patterns and I felt reaffirmed that the way I used to walk was actually better suited for me. She gave me some exercises to do as well, and they are kicking my ass, literally.

The problem child for my foot, we believe, is weakness in the [abductor hallucis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductor_hallucis_muscle). My gait was a bit wide, and we believe this was causing me to roll off my big toe at an angle (pushing it toward the center of my foot), instead of straight on.

I’ve started paying more attention to how I walk and trying to do it the way I used to. More mid- and front-strike, a bit more narrow, and ensuring the feet are pointed straight. Consider walking on a balance beam only slightly wider.
