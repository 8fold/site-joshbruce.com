## Sunday, October 15th, 2023

I think I'm settling into a cadence for these posts. Mainly, I'm thinking once a week, probably on the weekend. With that said, if something interesting enough happens on a given day, and I remember to write it out, and I'm in a position to do so, I will. That's a whole lotta conditions and caveats.

But I did set a reminder for myself to do so, similar to what I do with the [building wealth paycheck-to-paycheck](/experiences/finances/paycheck-to-paycheck/) series.

I updated [September](/experiences/health-and-wellness/historical-summaries/202309/) with a few things and fixed a  bug related to this content, so I won't recap that here. Instead, I will talk about how much I've had to recalibrate heading into this week.

Becca and I went out of town the last week of September. Then, three days later, we went out of town again. To say I fell off the wagon a bit would be an understatement, but I did stick with the nutrition plan set by [MacroFactor](/examinations/macrofactor-food-tracker/). With that said, I'm not sure how much I can say this was falling off the wagon as it was avoiding injury.

I'm going to say two things really messed me up:

1. butterfly pose and
2. walking backwards.

Let's start with the butterfly pose. I added it to the morning system integrity check to help stretch the groin and that general area. If you don't know butterfly pose in yoga, it's where you sit on the ground, put the bottoms of your feet together, bring the feet toward you, and (at least for me) try to get the knees on the ground or roughly in line with the top of the hips. I get into position, stretch to a point of slight discomfort, and count for 30 seconds; actually, I do a 4-count inhale followed by an 8-count exhale and repeat that 3 times. Then I release sping myself around and "bang out the stretch" and do a bit of massage. I follow that with some breathwork before returning to the position a second time for another 30 seconds.

The first few days were amazing. Then, I started developing discomfort, sliding into pain in the groin area. So, I backed off for a bit.

When I initially started walking backward, I started with the prescribed 10 minutes to see how the body would respond. During the walk, it was awesome. It's an interesting perspective shift. Then I started developing pain, not just discomfort that might become pain, but pain in the quadriceps and calves.

I gave myself a few days to recover fully from all that, only doing the active recovery provided by walking.

All right, so what do we change?

First things first, the next time I get an updated prescription, I'm going to just start slow instead of experimenting first and scaling back, if necessary.

I scaled back the walking backward to 2.5 minutes instead of 10 and kept the butterfly pose as is with the thought of going 3 times per week if things didn't dramatically improve.

Things did improve, and I finally felt comfortable doing a full day's worth of movements. The full, scaled-back physical therapy prescription and the modified MovNat Fundamentals Week 1, Day 1 routine.

Mistakes were made.

My entire body overall was in at least some form of discomfort. My upper legs and hips were in pain territory. I hit the brakes on everythingâ€”except the nutrition recommendations from MacroFactor, which we'll get to in a moment.

So, what changes are we making (changes are in italics)?

1. 3 sets of 10 single-leg hip rotations 3 times a week; I'll still do 1 set slowly in the shower as part of the system integrity check.
2. *3 sets of 5 split-leg calf raises daily. Walking backward hits the calves pretty hard, and I'd rather build into verifying I can still do 15 every day than try and start there only to regret it later.*
3. 3 sets of 10 toe abductions daily.
4. *3 sets of 2 distal quad stretches daily. Walking backward also engages the quadriceps; I wasn't doing 5 repetitions before. So, would like to build back up instead of trying to go all out.*
5. 3 sets of 10 [Powell raises](https://youtu.be/CuCAMi8pRWo) twice a week.
6. *1 set of 5 [reverse step-ups](https://youtu.be/7PV_bGLFlfY) 4 times weekly (no more than every other day). These also hit the hamstring and quadricep, so scaling back will build into the 25-repetition goal.*
7. During the walks
	- *Walk backward for 2.5 minutes once per day. Again, this is quadricep- and calf-dominate, so scaling back. I'm planning on increasing this to 5 minutes once per day and seeing how that goes. If it goes well, I'll increase the others before increasing the time walking backward again.*
8. MovNat Fundamentals Week 1, Day 1
	- Replace the deep squat with the deep knee bend.
	- *Replace foot-hand crawl with a bear crawl (shorter steps) and hold for 30 seconds (with a goal of holding for 60 seconds). This, I think, is what I think contributed the most to back, knee, hamstring, and glute discomfort. So, instead of pushing myself into movement, I will just hold and see what happens.*
	- *With that said, I'll go back to just the warm-up 3 times a week and see how things go. Then, progress into the warm-up along with the emphasis. And, eventually, the full sequence.*

Let's get back to the MacroFactor recommendations.

I started using MacroFactor in late August of 2023. I'm curious if it can be a decent enough nutrition coach and resource to save me money in the long run compared to actually hiring a nutrition coach.

You set a goal. Create a plan. And, based on the goal, the plan will adjust using your food consumption and weight over time. For the last 2 months, the changes in the plan can be summarized as "Eat more food!" Unfortunately, since I stopped being as active when I received the new physical therapy prescription, it was becoming increasingly difficult to maintain.

My weight didn't change in either direction and hasn't for the week we've been back, but, holy shit, that's a lot of food. We're just talking volume here. Leading up to the end of this week, I started feeling bloated, gassy, and constipated despite still having regular bowel movements.

I also couldn't weigh myself for over a week, which meant the app was basing everything on historical trends. Of course, the app didn't know I basically went from doing cardio and lifting to nothing.

Again, mistakes were made.

This brings us to today and what I'll change with the app.

Basically, if the trend of my activity changes or I cannot weigh in regularly, I'll adjust the program.

Outside of the app, I'm planning on changing my nutrition. More nutritionally dense foods and less high volume foods.

For example, I'm pretty sure I can replace the eggs with sunflower seeds; 3 eggs are estimated at 150 grams compared to 100 grams of sunflower seeds. This will increase caloric and fat intake while maintaining and improving the micronutrient profile compared to eggs. This would reduce my need to cook with a pan and fire by one meal. Given the increase in calories, I should also be able to remove the carrots and broccoli from the breakfast meal entirely, further reducing the volume of food.

If I remove the chicken thigh from my dinner, which I'm not sure I can do without adding something else, then no more pan and fire is required.

I won't need a microwave if I switch to green peas from a can instead of a microwavable bag. At that point, it's just a freezer for smoothie-related things, a cupboard, and a blender. And van life is prepared.
