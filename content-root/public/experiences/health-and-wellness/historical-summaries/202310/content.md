## Saturday, October 14th, 2023

I think I’m settling in on a cadence and format for this set of content; apologies for the bumps. At a minimum I’ll post once a week, usually on Saturday or Sunday. If there’s nothing of note for a specific day (or not enough content to have a day-specific section), I’ll leave that day out of consideration or just include it in a weekly summary. I’m also tracking a bug I’ll try to resolve soon.

The latest physical therapy prescription has caused me to reset progress in a lot of areas. If I didn’t reset we’d be in the territory of compounding discomfort leading to pain leading to unjustly. That falls under the heading of not good.
