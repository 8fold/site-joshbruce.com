Let's get back on the toenails for a second.

My left big toenail is growing attached to the nailbed and without curling under. During the week, I use pedicure tools to lift and flatten the nail. While holding the nail in the flattened position, I'll apply the anti-fungal lacquer to the base of the toenail. The theory is that the lacquer will reduce the nail's rebound and curl. It seems to be working, and I can feel the nail reestablishing the groove.

My right big toenail is also flattening out more. It may not be growing normally across the nail, though. The middle of the nail isn't growing or even trying to. The last time I gave myself a pedicure, the nail on the inside edge wasn't securely attached, and I trimmed it back to the attachment point. I use the lacquer on this toenail as well.

My right second toenail is responding to the anti-fungal lacquer. The layers of the nail are blown out, similar to what happened with the right big toenail.

From a nutrition perspective, things are going well. The caloric intake has reduced again. I no longer need a stovetop or frying pan.

From a physical fitness perspective, I am still working to bring myself back up to par.

I've added all my projects to the [8fold Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/8fold). I've also added the book titles to my account on [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/u/itsjoshbruce). (If you'd like to show your support or interest, that would be lovely and greatly appreciated.)

I'm planning to start publishing chapters in January. I'm also preparing two different websites. One is geared toward helping individuals, and another focuses on coaching and assisting organizations.
