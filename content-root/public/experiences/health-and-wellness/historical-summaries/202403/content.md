Becca and I were traveling the last couple of weeks. We flew into Denver, Colorado on the 15th. Picked up a rental car. Hung out for a couple of days. Drove to Portland, Oregon. Went to a conference for a few days. Then drove back to Louisville, Kentucky.

Since this is about health and wellness, we’ll stick to that.

When traveling, I don’t take my full meal-prep setup. Mainly, I’m not able to bring the things I need to make smoothies. Luckily, since shifting to my latest setup, I can bring the seeds and protein bars, and I did. This [saves money](/experiences/finances/paycheck-to-paycheck/) as well, because half of my calories come from those two things.

Unfortunately, my carry-on duffel bag was flagged by security. The person ended up unpacking all the seeds and protein bars. Each bar had a wand run over it. I apologized to the person going through the bag. They shrugged it off. I also said, “If we weren’t roadtripping back, it wouldn’t be like this.” 28 bags of seeds (100g each) and 28 protein bars later we were through security.

They did compliment my commitment to healthy eating, and I thanked them and joked that it helps counterbalance the smoking; they were repacking my packs of cigarettes at the time. They were respectful and kind to my belongings and managed to put things back together pretty well.

We wore masks in the airport and on the plane. (Still haven’t tested positive for COVID, and I’d like to keep that streak alive.)

We’ll talk more about the trip itself in the April 1st Paycheck article. For now, I want to focus on health and wellness things.

We arrived in Portland, Oregon and stayed overnight before day one of the conference the following day (Wednesday). It was good times. I did a session on [The 5 Ps](/essays-and-editorials/the-5-ps/). I was questioned by the person who coordinated the meals at the conference because I brought my own food. I assured them they did a wonderful job. The food selection was very inclusive, and I did eat the provided food as well as what I brought.

Thursday, woke up in the yellow according to [WHOOP](/examinations/whoop-health-monitor/). I decided not to attend any sessions, I just walked around the conference, and had some good conversations. Becca and I did a session called *No Spikes in the Mosh Pit* as [The Irreverent Agilists](https://the-irreverent-agilists.com). I started not feeling well. Lots of mucus. I started saying it was hotel crud, as opposed to con crud. My concern was COVID. But, as I was blowing my nose, the discoloration led me to believe it was the beginnings of a sinus infection.

Given my allergy response around the Ohio River, I’m all too familiar with this.

I started my normal regimen of copious amounts of vitamin C when we got back to the hotel.

Friday, WHOOP had me in the red, but just barely (33 percent). My sleep looked as if I had run a marathon. Being awake made it even worse. Physically and mentally I felt pretty good, but the human body doesn’t produce that much snot unless something weird is happening. So much nose-blowing and productive coughing. This was the last day of the conference. We met some of our new friends and hung out until midnight.

Saturday, was another red recovery; this time 18 percent. But, my sinuses weren’t getting worse, and the treatment was doing its thing. I was a bit brain foggy, but still better. We walked to meet up with a friend of Becca’s. They mentioned a good ramen place was nearby. After walking through a large market for a couple of hours, I asked if we could go the ramen place.

You know it’s bad if I’m asking for soup-like food.

The ramen was just what I needed. I ended up downing two orders. When we left, I immediately separated from the group and headed to the hotel. When I got back, I put the fan on high and just left the room door open to try and circulate the air a bit.

Sunday, we were starting the trek back, and my assessment to Becca was that I was allergic to Portland. This is about the time when she too started feeling less than stellar in the sinus department. We left later than anticipated.

Over the course of the three days back, I started feeling better and better, and WHOOP agreed. Today I woke up to a 99 percent recovery.

I have some built up earwax in my left ear that’s annoying. This came up during my physical with my new doctor and I’m planning to start doing something about it over the next couple of days.

Beyond that, feeling pretty good, despite being behind on a lot of the regularly scheduled programming. So, going to be setting timers and doing the things, once I actually roll out of bed for real as opposed to the couple of false starts I’ve already had.

Feeling pretty good for the last couple of weeks.

Pedicure went well. The toenail second digit on the right foot is still working itself out, but the new nail growth is thinner, which I’m taking as a good sign. I was also able to remove some of the toenail this time, which I wasn’t able to do last time.

I thinned out the toenail on the big toes on both feet. It really seems to help them flatten out. I’m not sure which fix to focus on to be honest; the fungus or the flattening. The lacquer helps fight the fungus, but covers and thickens the nail. The thicker the nail, the more it’ll maintain its shape, which isn’t good if the nail isn’t flat.

I’m able to touch the floor now, not just the tops of my feet or toes. I still can’t touch my fingers when putting my hands behind my back. I’ve also been doing counter stretches for my neck, which seems to be helping with tightening up the skin around my jawline and back of my skull.

I’m changing primary care physicians. I favor direct pay primary care services and found one more familiar with musculoskeletal modalities, “alternative lifestyles,” and treating the whole person. I was impressed by the intake process, what was involved with the annual check, and the bedside manner of the doctor.
