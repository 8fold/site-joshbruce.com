Feeling pretty good for the last couple of weeks.

Pedicure went well. The toenail second digit on the right foot is still working itself out, but the new nail growth is thinner, which I’m taking as a good sign. I was also able to remove some of the toenail this time, which I wasn’t able to do last time.

I thinned out the toenail on the big toes on both feet. It really seems to help them flatten out. I’m not sure which fix to focus on to be honest; the fungus or the flattening. The lacquer helps fight the fungus, but covers and thickens the nail. The thicker the nail, the more it’ll maintain its shape, which isn’t good if the nail isn’t flat.

I’m able to touch the floor now, not just the tops of my feet or toes. I still can’t touch my fingers when putting my hands behind my back. I’ve also been doing counter stretches for my neck, which seems to be helping with tightening up the skin around my jawline and back of my skull.

I’m changing primary care physicians. I favor direct pay primary care services and found one more familiar with musculoskeletal modalities, “alternative lifestyles,” and treating the whole person. I was impressed by the intake process, what was involved with the annual check, and the bedside manner of the doctor.
