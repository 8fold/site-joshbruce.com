# July 2023

{!! dateblock !!}

Still figuring out how best to create these entries. I may switch to monthly entries instead of yearly, with each month as a section. Further, I will try subdividing things a bit regarding movements to distinguish between prescribed (by a professional) and additional movements I'm putting in as well. Finally, I'm considering separating improvement areas from degradation (wins and losses).

Not feeling so good.

**Losses:**

My right middle finger started feeling like it was jammed or sprained along the extensor tendon. Do this:

1. Open your hand (fingers in extension or neutral).
2. Keeping the middle finger straight, bend it toward the palm (flexion).

If you feel a slight pain or burning on the first finger bone (proximal phalanges) along the back (or top), then you're experiencing what I was (am) experiencing. This pain sensation was present even when putting all fingers into flexion, though it was reduced. Further, try this:

1. Open your hand.
2. Spread your fingers apart (abduction).
3. Now, without moving the other fingers, alternate between trying to touch your index finger or ring finger with the middle finger (lateral movement).

If you feel a similar pain or burning in the same spot, you are experiencing something similar to what I was (am) experiencing.

*To overcome:* I found that pulling the finger straight (in line with the palm) and moving the [fingers into extension](https://youtu.be/dkFissmuCrk) seems to reduce the pain and increase mobility. Even though these movements are about relieving pain, not increasing mobility, for the sake of documentation, I will say I can extend the finger roughly 45 degrees beyond neutral, while most of the others can go farther.

The other major loss this week was my perceived limited ability to perform the prescribed exercises for their full sets and reps. I tried to keep the transverse planar slouch as much as possible, as it seems to be reaping the most total-body benefits.

Some minor regressions aren't impactful enough to mention. Suffice it to say, I'm feeling more pain and discomfort, but none of it is debilitating or causing me to be laid up for a week, as has been the norm this year.

**Wins:**

1. Finding a way to reduce the pain in the left middle finger ([see the stretches in this video](https://youtu.be/uPO-zST-7EE)).
2. We drove a couple of thousand miles, and at no point during the trip did my right ankle or knee complain as they have in the past; external rotation of my right leg seems to be improving.
3. I got to see [Cyan headquarters](https://cyan.com) in person and meet Rand Miller. (Scratching that off my bucket list.)
4. I got to see where Becca was a kid and take some tours and things.
