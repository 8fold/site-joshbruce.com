I switched primary care physicians and so far I’m pleased with the results.

My annual bloodwork came back and my high cholesterol is now low (mainly due to diet, I think). Uric acid is still on the high side, but I’m hoping that has to do with dehydration. On the dehydration note (and indicators), there were crystals that indicate possible kidney stones or dehydration (I’m going with dehydration for now).

Finally had my vasectomy verified; been a few years. It seems to have stuck according to the results. Bodies are amazingly weird, though, so I’m curious about having a check done every few years.

WHOOP data has been pretty good the last week, and I’m not planning on changing too much on that score.

From a mental and emotional score I’m doing very well. Feeling very loved and appreciated from my partners. Feeling pretty accomplished and optimistic about the future.

I’m feeling a bit of anxiety and healthy stress around learning more about accounting and bookkeeping specifically.
