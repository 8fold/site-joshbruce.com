Feeling pretty good. I caught up on calls and think [The Rotation](/experiences/the-system/#the-rotation) is back on track. Returning to standing and working a standard 8-hour day is also going well. Toenails are uncurling, and the universe and humanity continue progressing forward in time.

The only residual oddity I've been noticing is sometimes, during what I will classify as regular exertion, I sweat a lot more than I remember sweating in the past.
