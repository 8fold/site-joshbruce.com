## Saturday, September 2, and Sunday, September 3, 2023

Active recovery days.

Saturday I increased my grocery walk to 5 miles instead of 4 by adding one loop around the 1-mile block I use in the morning. 

While walking to the convenience store I witnessed a car accident. It was enough to spin an [.SUV](Sports Utility Vehicle) around and bend the rear tire in and release the side airbags. I checked on everyone, and they said they were okay, which wasn’t true given what I saw. Some joggers paused and called emergency services. While they were doing that I walked back up the road a ways to start waving people over, because the driver of the car responsible for the accident didn’t want to move it.

When the officer arrived their lights helped signal people to get over, so I wasn’t needed there anymore. The officer asked the drivers of the offending car to get it off the main road. I have the officer and the drivers space to chat. Then the officer looked at me and asked, “And your part in all of this?”

“Nothing,” I answered. “Just a witness. I was over there,” and pointed to the piece of sidewalk I was on when accident happened.

“Well, they’re both telling me the same story, so, you’re not really needed.”

I said, “Thank you,” and waved to everyone as I continued on my merry way.

The plan going into this week I’m looking at thee following changes:

1. Increase all split calf raise sets to 15 repetitions.
2. Add a third set of single leg hip rotations at 5 repetitions to each day.
3. Complete the full MovNat Fundamentals Week 1, Day 1 to Monday and Friday.
4. Consider something different for Wednesday compared to the MovNat Fundamentals Week 1, Day 1 warm-up movements I’ve been doing. There’s a helper video that works on different aspects of the deep squat, which is a problem area for me, mainly because of ankle dorsiflexion.

## Friday, September 1, 2023

Good day.

Morning routine went well. Both 2-mile walks went well. Physical therapy rounds went well.

Funny story on that score, [yesterday](/experiences/health-and-wellness/historical-summaries/202308/), I was thinking I could go ahead and increase the split calf raises to set of 15, but kept myself humble. Had to do the same thing today.

Completed the MovNat Fundamentals Week 1, Day 1 session for the second time.

I chatted with a friend on the rotation.

Becca and I had a movie date with pizza.
