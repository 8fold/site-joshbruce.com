Good day.

Morning routine went well. Both 2-mile walks went well. Physical therapy rounds went well.

Funny story on that score, [yesterday](/experiences/health-and-wellness/historical-summaries/202308/), I was thinking I could go ahead and increase the split calf raises to set of 15, but kept myself humble. Had to do the same thing today.

Completed the MovNat Fundamentals Week 1, Day 1 session for the second time.

I chatted with a friend on the rotation.

Becca and I had a movie date with pizza.
