According to WHOOP, this was my first day of reaching over 90 percent recovery. 

I knew I would be seeing my [physical therapist](https://www.instagram.com/theunbrokenacademy/), and didn't do a full-on set because I didn't want to be any more messed up when I saw her.

We talked about the exercises I felt I was adapting to and my realization regarding my left leg.

My left leg wasn't getting the memo in the same way my right leg was. During the transverse planar slouch, my right leg would start by overusing the groin and hip flexors; however, it would eventually key in the glutes and outside of the hamstring area. Meanwhile, my left leg never shifted away from the groin and hip flexors. During the inverted wall press, everything in my body felt like it was just another day at the beach, except the back of my left knee, which always felt like it was trying to stretch. During the calf raises, I noticed that my left calf wasn't contributing as much to the overall effort.

I told her about the pain in my hands and feet. She confirmed that was weird, but not to the point of extra concern.

In short, the leg that passed the movement tests with flying colors seems like it managed to do so because of various layers of compensations, not by using the muscles it was supposed to.

Modifications were made:

1. Single-leg calf raises instead of calf raises while holding the ball. Start with the left leg, and repeat the same number of reps with the right leg.
2. Single arm wall press with hand down to try and elongate the muscles in my forearm.
3. We moved from rockback breathing on the ground to wall breathing, still emphasizing breathing into and expanding the back of the ribcage.

I've added walking a mile in the morning to my routine. This is to replicate the walking to an office building I used to do. When walking to an office, it would have counted as passive exercise. Since walking now is for its own sake, it's considered active exercise.

I also increased my water intake to about 1 ounce per pound of body weight.

The last two days were pretty intense regarding body transformation and adaptation. I went to bed around 7 pm. Was wide awake at midnight. I lay in bed and meditated mainly, trying to be as relaxed as possible. The [WHOOP](/examinations/whoop-health-monitor/) showed me as asleep most of that time. 

I did the 1-mile walk in the morning. Took a nap. I did all my physical therapy exercises and additional components from the [MovNat](https://www.movnat.com) week 1 day 1 workout; just some warmup movements.

Felt like I slept well. Was able to do all the physical therapy things. 

- No stiffness
- Low-grade discomfort and pain similar to the previous day.

This was my second day doing the vagal nerve stimulation and pelvic floor exercises.
