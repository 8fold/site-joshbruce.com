81 percent recovery.

Both one mile walks. Did both at almost 3.5 miles per hour.

Same set of exercises as August 7; scaling back the single-leg calf raises to 10 per side.

## Sunday, August 13, 2023

78 percent recovery.

This day was a bitch.

Before eating breakfast I did my store run. This is a 4 mile walk, part of which is with added weight; luckily it was a light grocery day. When I got home, I unloaded all the groceries, and did the exercises in the Reminders app.

Then I ate breakfast.

It was my day to scrub bathrooms, so I did that; that’s a whole exercise routine in and of itself. I also swept the kitchen, hall, and small foyer area in the apartment. I also did the wood conditioning for those areas.

Lots of sweat.

I also packed in all my meals before 4 to try and give more time between my last meal and sleep. This hurt.

## Saturday, August 12, 2023

81 percent recovery.

Both 1 mile walks.

I did the full run of movements from the 10th.

I started feeling more severe muscle soreness in my calves and hips. I decided to reduce the number of hip rotations and calf raises. My goal is to try and be able to do all the things each day.

## Friday, August 11, 2023

95 percent recovery.

I only did the morning 1 mile walk because Becca and I need to head to a float tank session right after work. There was walking involved, but it wasn’t tracked.

I did the shower routine from the previous day, and the throughout the day routine less the hip rotations.

## Thursday, August 10, 2023

I think the way I’ll handle things is that if my recovery is less or equal 50 percent, I’ll take a rest day. If my recovery score is greater than 50 percent, I’ll do whatever is in the Reminders app for that day.

In the shower I did 5 one-legged slow hip rotations; both sides. Everything else was the same from the previous day.

I did both 1 mile walks at a speed less than 3 miles per hour.

Shower routine:

1. 5 standing hip rotations, exceedingly slow; both sides.
2. 20 hip lifts; both sides.
3. 10 wall presses; both sides.
4. 30 toe abductions; seated.
5. Foot massage, traction, and toe torsion.
6. 2 minutes assisted toe and ankle extensions; both sides.
7. 2 minutes assisted toe and ankle dorsiflexions; both sides.
8. 10 rounds of vagal nerve stimulation breath work; 4 count inhale, chin lock and 4 count hold, 8 count exhale (after releasing chin lock).
9. 10 rounds of 10 pelvic floor contractions.

When possible, I did the following throughout the workday:

1. Rock back breathing (5 count), 10 cat-cows, and upward-facing dog; once.
2. 10 cat-cows, and upward-facing dog; twice.
3. Wall breathing; 10 breaths. (Usually right after number 1.)
4. 15 single-leg calf raises; both sides, 3 times.
5. Pectoral corner stretch; 10 breaths. (Usually right after number 4.)
6. Single arm wall press, hand down. (Usually right after number 5.)
7. Couch quad stretch; 10 breaths, both sides, 3 times. (Usually after number 6.)
8. 10 one-legged hip rotations; both sides, 2 times.

Didn’t have a good recovery after Monday and Tuesday. My ankle muscles (not my calves) were very annoyed. My left hamstring is awake now; also not happy about it.

I decided I’d cut back on the reps moving forward, and would take the day to focus on active recovery stuff.

In the shower I did a regular one-legged slouch; 10 reps, both sides. The hip lifts and everything else was the same from the previous day.

I did both 1 mile walks, and breathing meditation.

I also started paying close attention to the way I was standing.

I’ve been standing at work since the late 90s while working retail and the early-aughts while at a desk. So, I haven’t really paid much attention.

I think my body has developed some anti-patterns and unhealthy compensations. I have also developed some interesting habits.

The first one I realized was that I tend to favor standing on my right leg when I stand on one leg throughout the day. I also tend to lock my left knee when standing on both feet; my right tends to be me relaxed. 

I started experimenting with not locking my knee, and standing on my left leg when shifting to one leg.

By the end of the day the bottom of my left mid-foot was pissed.

## Tuesday, August 8, 2023

Same shower routine as the day before.

One modification to the exercises throughout the day. During 2 of the rounds I did 10 standing hip rotations, both sides; I plan to do these on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays. (Really trying to wake up my left ass cheek, and strengthen the right.)

I decided to add an evening 1 mile lap to my days. That brings me up to 2 miles per day, with a longer bit on the weekend for grocery run.

4. 15 single-leg calf raises; both sides, 3 times.
5. Pectoral corner stretch; 10 breaths. (Usually right after number 4.)
6. Single arm wall press, hand down. (Usually right after number 5.)
7. Couch quad stretch; 10 breaths, both sides, 3 times. (Usually after number 6.)

This gives me the ability to create 3 pretty solid rounds, starting the cat-cow and with the couch quad stretch. And I just do three rounds to two per day.

I’ve decided to try and do the week 1 day 1 warmup from the MovNat Fundamentals course on Mondays. It went pretty well.

## Thursday, August 4 to Monday, August 6, 2023

Decided to take a couple of recovery days, so not much going on or of note.

## Thursday, August 3, 2023

According to WHOOP, this was my first day of reaching over 90 percent recovery. 

I knew I would be seeing my [physical therapist](https://www.instagram.com/theunbrokenacademy/), and didn't do a full-on set because I didn't want to be any more messed up when I saw her.

We talked about the exercises I felt I was adapting to and my realization regarding my left leg.

My left leg wasn't getting the memo in the same way my right leg was. During the transverse planar slouch, my right leg would start by overusing the groin and hip flexors; however, it would eventually key in the glutes and outside of the hamstring area. Meanwhile, my left leg never shifted away from the groin and hip flexors. During the inverted wall press, everything in my body felt like it was just another day at the beach, except the back of my left knee, which always felt like it was trying to stretch. During the calf raises, I noticed that my left calf wasn't contributing as much to the overall effort.

I told her about the pain in my hands and feet. She confirmed that was weird, but not to the point of extra concern.

In short, the leg that passed the movement tests with flying colors seems like it managed to do so because of various layers of compensations, not by using the muscles it was supposed to.

Modifications were made:

1. Single-leg calf raises instead of calf raises while holding the ball. Start with the left leg, and repeat the same number of reps with the right leg.
2. Single arm wall press with hand down to try and elongate the muscles in my forearm.
3. We moved from rockback breathing on the ground to wall breathing, still emphasizing breathing into and expanding the back of the ribcage.

I've added walking a mile in the morning to my routine. This is to replicate the walking to an office building I used to do. When walking to an office, it would have counted as passive exercise. Since walking now is for its own sake, it's considered active exercise.

I also increased my water intake to about 1 ounce per pound of body weight.

The last two days were pretty intense regarding body transformation and adaptation. I went to bed around 7 pm. Was wide awake at midnight. I lay in bed and meditated mainly, trying to be as relaxed as possible. The [WHOOP](/examinations/whoop-health-monitor/) showed me as asleep most of that time. 

I did the 1-mile walk in the morning. Took a nap. I did all my physical therapy exercises and additional components from the [MovNat](https://www.movnat.com) week 1 day 1 workout; just some warmup movements.

## Tuesday, August 1, 2023

Felt like I slept well. Was able to do all the physical therapy things. 

- No stiffness
- Low-grade discomfort and pain similar to the previous day.

This was my second day doing the vagal nerve stimulation and pelvic floor exercises.
