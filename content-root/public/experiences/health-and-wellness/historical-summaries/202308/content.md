## Friday, August 24, 2023

Muscle soreness started kicking in. Despite having a good recovery, I decided to have a rest day.

I did:

1. 10 hip rotations on both sides.
2. 20 hip lifts on both sides.
3. 10 wall presses on both sides.
4. Foot massage variations.
5. Toe releases and mobilizations.
6. Foot extensions.
7. Foot dorsiflexions.
8. Hand releases.
9. Vagal nerve stimulation.
10. Pelvic floor contractions.
11. 2-mile walk.

Most of this list makes up the non-negotiables for right now. It’s the shower routine, and is doing wonders.

It was crazy hot and humid this day. My morning walk was at a 3.5 mile per hour pace. By the end I hadn’t done any zone 2 cardio and I was so awash with sweat I needed to take off my shirt; to say nothing of how warm I was. 

The outside thigh and hip area is not pleased. My knees (more the right than left) don’t seem to appreciate being asked to move through their full range of motion and stay there. Hips and hamstrings are a bit spicy; not a lot, but noticeable.

In other news, I took a shower and some ibuprofen to cut off a migraine before it got too bad. In the shower I learned I can bend and balance to the point that I can touch my toes (for the first time in my life). Not that but I can do from a position of strength and control.

**Changes:**

1. Take weekends off; sort of.
2. Do 2-miles daily, at minimum.
3. Do as much of the shower routine as possible every day.
4. ‌MovNat on Friday, not beginning or middle of week.
5. Increasing protein intake to 190 grams per day, plus or minus 10.
6. I bought a scale; my body has apparently adopted a set point of 240 pounds (100 kilograms).
7. 10 hip rotations per set.

I’m finding after a couple days of active recovery or rest, when I get back to it, I can do more without feeling as drained. So, I’ve decided I’m going to take weekends off.

The weekends off but comes with 2 caveat. First, I want these days to be spent in active recovery. Second, I want to be doing some conditioning work. So, I’ll keep the 2-mile minimum walk and shower routine.

Doing the entire MovNat week 1, day 1 on Wednesday was a great psychological boost. I didn’t feel fatigued and probably could have kept going in the moment. I’m glad I didn’t because a day later my knees started talking back and by Friday I was experiencing low-level delayed onset muscle soreness over the entire body. Therefore, I’m going to move that routine to Friday, and delay my desire to do it on Mondays and Fridays. If I can do the full routine, and not feel it by Monday, I’ll reassess increasing to twice a week. 

For the last few weeks I’ve been experimenting with not changing my diet despite knowing it’s not as “dialed in” as it could be. Given the way some of my joints have been responding, I’ve decided to add glucosamine chondroitin to my daily pillbox; see if that does anything. I’m also increasing my protein intake to roughly 190 grams per day (the [math behind that number](https://youtu.be/Pok0Jg2JAkE?feature=shared)). Given the methods and science available, my minimum daily protein intake should be 180 grams; for a while now, I’ve been around 140 to 165. If I were a body builder going through a bulking phase, I’d want to push that up to around 200 grams per day. Given my goal is functional movement, I’m going to shoot for 190, and see what happens.

I don’t put much stock in weight; however, a lot of fitness calculations use weight (mass) to do their thing. For example, I try and drink 0.75 to 1 ounce of water per pound of body weight. That’s 240 ounces of water on the high side; roughly 1.9 gallons. If my body weight drops to its previous set point of 220 pounds, I’d only be aiming for 220 ounces of water on the high side. And dropping to 190 (where I was at the peak of the aesthetics projects), would be even easier to attain and maintain each day. Anyway, not sure how often I’ll check the scale, but I have one. It’s a straight dial, and I might use it more often to test grip strength than measure body weight.

I had been doing 8 hip rotations. It feels like I can do that number without experiencing muscle soreness, so I’m increasing. Basically, this lands me at a total of 30 on the days I do all three sets. If I can manage that load, I might switch to doing 20 every weekday before progressing to trying 30 every weekday.

## Thursday, August 24, 2023

Did my 2-mile walk, and that was about it.

We needed to checkout of where we were staying, and I had the tea, then drove home.

I did some hip rotations, hip lifts, and wall presses in the small shower. I’m pretty sure I did the hand releases as well. 

I think I’m getting a feel for non-negotiables; the things I’ll try to make sure always get done, at least for now.

## Wednesday, August 23, 2023

Becca and I are traveling so she can have some in-office time for her job, and I can get a medical test done.

The list of movements I needed to do was a complete stack.

You might be asking, "What does that mean?"

That means I wanted to complete the following:

1. 3 sets of 10 single-leg hip rotations; one set is extremely slow on both sides.
2. 1 set of 20 hip lifts; on both sides.
3. 10 regular wall presses; on both sides.
4. Hand releases.
5. 3 variations of foot massage for the bottom of my feet.
6. 3 sets of 10 toe abductions.
7. Toe mobilizations for each toe and both feet.
8. 2 minutes of active foot extensions.
9. 2 minutes of active foot dorsiflexions.
10. 10 rounds of vagal nerve stimulation breathing.
11. 10 rounds of pelvic floor contractions.
12. A single 2-mile walk at 3 miles per hour.
13. A single 1-mile walk at 3 miles per hour.
14. 10 transverse planar slouches; on both sides.
15. 10 split calf raises; on both sides.
16. 3 sets of pectoral wall stretches for 10 breaths.
17. 3 sets of 10 wall presses hand down; on both sides.
18. 3 sets of couch quad stretches for 10 breaths; on both sides.
19. 2 sets of 10 cat cows to upward-facing dog for 10 breaths.
20. 1 set of 5 rock back breaths to 10 cat cows to upward-facing dog for 10 breaths.
19. Supine lying for 5 breaths (3 times), prone lying for 10 breaths (2 times), and rolling to get from supine to prone.
20. Bent sit for 10 breaths.
21. Side bent sit for 10 breaths; on both sides, at least, with a transition.
22. Kneeling, tall kneeling (twice), and flex foot kneeling for 10 breaths.
23. Knee hand for 5 breaths.
24. MovNat Fundamentals week 1, day 1, which consists of:
	1. Supine lying with rolling to prone both ways, resulting in supine lying 3 or 4 times.
	2. Bent sit position for a few breaths.
	3. Side bent sit both sides 3 or 4 times using the transition.
	4. Kneeling, tall kneeling, to flex foot kneeling; a few times with transitions.
	5. 3 or 4 deep squats.
	6. 6-foot knee hand crawl forward and reverse a few times.
	7. A 6-foot foot hand crawl forward a couple of times.
	8. 3 or 4 rounds of the following:
		1. 6-foot foot hand crawl forward, turnaround, and back to start.
		2. Side bent sit with transitions 3 or 4 times.
		3. 6 repetitions of kneeling, tall kneeling, to flex foot kneeling.

That may seem like a lot, and it is. Doing it all in one sitting takes just over 2 hours to complete.

A couple of things to consider:

1. Many of these movements or exercises are low-impact and medium-load.
2. I'm focused on getting to a point where I can move without injuring myself for a week at a time despite what I'm doing not being some hardcore parkour-level stuff, and so far, it's working.
3. My goal, at present, is adaptation more than anything. Specifically adapting myself to more strenuous movements and being comfortable being in positions other than standing and lying down.
4. Last, and it probably should have been first, this isn't a normal day.

This isn't about achieving aesthetics; that was a different project. This is about improving the quality of life overall. Further, this is also about habit formation and lifestyle change that can be longer lasting. Finally, given my starting point, having a few additional things in the mix (like the active extension and dorsiflexion bits) should help accelerate to where I can regularly do other things to maintain a set point instead of digging out of a ditch.

This day, in particular, is odd because it's a result of not doing the exercises regularly over the past few days. At this point, I chose to do all of them on the same day. I'm doing what I normally do over the course of 3 days at the beginning of the week to 1 day.

How'd it go?

Very well, actually.

In the morning, I couldn't do my normal shower routine; the shower was too small. But, as soon as I finished the shower, I went through the stretching, massage, and breathing routine. Then I went for the 2-mile morning walk at about 3.5 miles per hour; most of that was at zone 2 heart rate. 

It was hot and humid, and I was sweating balls by the time I got back to the place we were staying. 

A few hours later, I did everything but the MovNat sequence. I've adapted enough at this point that, from a muscle strain perspective, it's pretty easy. With that said, the problem joints experienced some releases, which was great and needed.

A couple of hours later, I did the MovNat sequence. Not only that, but this was the first time I could complete the entire sequence, having only been able to get through the emphasis just a week before. So, the plan is to do the full MovNat week 1, day 1 twice during the week, most likely Monday and Friday.

## Sunday, August 20, 2023

42 percent recovery.

If memory serves, the WHOOP also gave me my third health monitor warning in as many days. The first warning was due to my respiratory rate being elevated. The second was due to a drop in my [.HRV](heart rate variability). The third was due to respiratory rate again.

I decided to modify the protocols related to WHOOP recovery.

1. Less than 33 percent don't do anything beyond the bare minimum.
2. Less than 50 percent shower and normal walks.
3. More than 50 percent do all the things.

## Saturday, August 19, 2023

32 percent recovery.

This is the first recovery I had in the red, I think. I felt okay. 

Despite the less-than-fifty protocol, I did my normal Saturday morning errands. I'm walking 4 miles, with part of that having my weekly groceries. I also needed to return the rental car, which resulted in a 2-mile walk back to the apartment.

## Friday, August 18, 2023

35 percent recovery.

I didn't do anything due to the less than 50 percent recovery protocol.

Went to the office early in the day and drove home around noon. 

Every day I was out of town, I ate the breakfast provided by the hotel. Mainly the eggs, with some standard pork products. It was a just-in-case measure since I didn't know what the company served for breakfast or lunch.

## Thursday, August 17, 2023

54 percent recovery.

Only a single 1-mile walk.

I had a lot of sugar that day at the training class. Probably not the wisest choice.

I was still away from home and didn't exercise because I hung out with some of my colleagues.

## Wednesday, August 16, 2023

91 percent recovery.

Both 1-mile walks.

The same exercises as August 14.

**MovNat related:**

I've been doing MovNat things for a few weeks, just didn't add them here. Apologies. I'll add them to the previous entries.

1. [Supine lying](https://youtu.be/7D_A3LHIxS8) for 5 breaths, emphasizing the expansion of my abdomen and the front of my ribcage, 3 times.
2. [Roll](https://youtu.be/7VhemDTTzns) (lower pattern) to prone lying driven by my left or right leg, emphasizing controlling the motion and moving from hips to lumbar to thoracic, 2 times. (Usually right after number 1.)
3. [Prone lying](https://youtu.be/KhWeLb4XTcY) for 5 breaths, emphasizing the expansion of my upper back (like rock back breathing), 2 times. (Usually right after number 2.)
4. Roll to supine driven by my left or right leg, similar to number 2. (Usually right after number 3.)
5. [Bent sit position](https://youtu.be/_bBxfsuiVbY) (or scaling back to [single pelvic tilts](https://youtu.be/RnAqH0_InbA), if necessary); on both sides.
6. [Side bent sit](https://youtu.be/XgFyVPkRVW4) for 5 breaths; on both sides. (Sometimes I do more. Sometimes I do the [side bent sit reverse](https://youtu.be/eHRsWxgud5E).)
7. [Kneeling](https://youtu.be/5nmzRBxU2Ms) for 5 breaths.
8. [Tall kneeling](https://youtu.be/HOne_Zq3RO8) for 5 breaths. (Usually after number 7.)
9. Flex foot tall kneeling for 5 breaths. (Usually after number 8.)
10. Flex foot kneeling for 5 breaths. (Usually after number 9.)
11. [Knee-hand position](https://youtu.be/AlrbuEoOk6k) for 5 breaths. (Usually as a "cool-down," where the rolling would be the "warm-up.")

MovNat sessions typically have 3 acts, so to speak. The warm-up, the emphasis, and the combo. I spend a lot of time on psychology, given where I am physically. This routine allows me to put my body into shapes that have recently resulted in strange injuries and pain without resulting in strange injuries and pain. Numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 are the warm-up. Numbers 5, 6, and 7 are the emphasis. Numbers 7, 8, 9, and 10 are the combination. Number 11 is the grounding to wind down.

Is this the way the MovNat coaches would break it down? Probably not, mainly because what I'm calling a combination may not be a combination. I call it a combination because I'm doing a combination of kneels and working on the mind-body connection needed to transition between the various kneels.

Something I appreciate about my physical therapist and MovNat as a practice is being able to breathe in the positions you put yourself in.

Right now, I've set this to be a routine I do on Wednesdays and Fridays. Initially, I did it every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday because I couldn't make it through the MovNat Fundamentals week 1 day 1 warm-up without feeling too fatigued to continue.

However, I decided one day (not sure when) to try the warm-up again, and I made it through the warm-up and part of the emphasis. So, that's what I do on Mondays.

## Tuesday, August 15, 2023

66 percent recovery.

Both 1-mile walks.

The same exercises as August 10.

I started driving in a rental to head to training at my employer's headquarters.

## Monday, August 14, 2023

81 percent recovery.

Both 1-mile walks. Did both at almost 3.5 miles per hour.

The same set of exercises as August 7; scaling back the single-leg calf raises to 10 per side.

## Sunday, August 13, 2023

78 percent recovery.

This day was a bitch.

Before eating breakfast, I did my store run. This is a 4-mile walk, part of which is with added weight; luckily, it was a light grocery day. When I got home, I unloaded all the groceries and did the exercises in the Reminders app.

Then I ate breakfast.

It was my day to scrub bathrooms, so I did that; that’s a whole exercise routine in and of itself. I also swept the apartment's kitchen, hall, and small foyer area. I also did the wood conditioning for those areas.

Lots of sweat.

I also packed in all my meals before 4 to try and give more time between my last meal and sleep. This hurt.

## Saturday, August 12, 2023

81 percent recovery.

Both 1-mile walks.

I did the full run of movements from the 10th.

I started feeling more severe muscle soreness in my calves and hips. I reduced the number of hip rotations (8 instead of 10) and calf raises (10 instead of 15). My goal is to try and be able to do all the things each day.

## Friday, August 11, 2023

95 percent recovery.

I only did the morning 1-mile walk because Becca and I need to head to a float tank session right after work. There was walking involved, but it wasn’t tracked.

I did the shower routine from the previous day and the throughout-the-day routine, less the hip rotations.

## Thursday, August 10, 2023

I think the way I’ll handle things is that if my recovery is less or equal to 50 percent, I’ll take a rest day. If my recovery score exceeds 50 percent, I’ll do whatever is in the Reminders app for that day.

In the shower, I did 5 one-legged slow hip rotations; on both sides. Everything else was the same as the previous day.

I did both 1-mile walks at less than 3 miles per hour.

**Shower routine:**

1. 5 standing hip rotations, exceedingly slow; both sides.
2. 20 hip lifts; on both sides.
3. 10 wall presses; on both sides.
4. 30 toe abductions; seated.
5. Foot massage, traction, and toe torsion.
6. 2 minutes assisted toe and ankle extensions; on both sides.
7. 2 minutes assisted toe and ankle dorsiflexions; on both sides.
8. 10 rounds of vagal nerve stimulation breath work; 4-count inhale, chin lock and 4-count hold, 8-count exhale (after releasing chin lock).
9. 10 rounds of 10 pelvic floor contractions.

**When possible, I did the following throughout the workday:**

1. Rock back breathing (5-count), 10 cat-cows, and upward-facing dog; once.
2. 10 cat-cows and upward-facing dog; twice.
3. Wall breathing; 10 breaths. (Usually right after number 1.)
4. 15 single-leg calf raises; both sides, 3 times.
5. Pectoral corner stretches; 10 breaths. (Usually right after number 4.)
6. Single arm wall press, hand down. (Usually right after number 5.)
7. Couch quad stretches; 10 breaths, both sides, 3 times. (Usually after number 6.)
8. 8 one-legged hip rotations; both sides, 2 times.

## Wednesday, August 9, 2023

Didn’t have a good recovery after Monday and Tuesday. My ankle muscles (not my calves) were very annoyed. My left hamstring is awake now; also not happy about it.

I decided I’d cut back on the reps moving forward and would take the day to focus on active recovery stuff.

I did a regular one-legged slouch in the shower, 10 reps on both sides. The hip lifts and everything else were the same as the previous day.

I did both 1-mile walks and breathing meditation.

I also started paying close attention to the way I was standing.

I’ve been standing at work since the late 90s while working retail and the early-aughts at a desk. So, I haven’t paid much attention.

I think my body has developed some anti-patterns and unhealthy compensations. I have also developed some interesting habits.

The first one I realized was that I tend to favor standing on my right leg when I stand on one leg throughout the day. I also lock my left knee when standing on both feet; my right tends to be relaxed. 

I started experimenting with not locking my knee and standing on my left leg when shifting to one leg.

By the end of the day, the bottom of my left mid-foot was pissed.

## Tuesday, August 8, 2023

Same shower routine as the day before.

One modification to the exercises throughout the day. During 2 of the rounds, I did 10 standing hip rotations on both sides; I plan to do these on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays. (Really trying to wake up my left ass cheek and strengthen the right.)

I decided to add an evening 1-mile lap to my days. That brings me up to 2 miles daily, with a longer bit for a grocery run on the weekend.

## Monday, August 7, 2023

**Shower routine:**

1. 5 standing hip rotations, exceedingly slow; both sides.
2. 20 hip lifts; on both sides.
3. 10 wall presses; on both sides.
4. 30 toe abductions; seated.
5. Foot massage, traction, and toe torsion.
6. 2 minutes assisted toe and ankle extensions; on both sides.
7. 2 minutes assisted toe and ankle dorsiflexions; on both sides.
8. 10 rounds of vagal nerve stimulation breath work; 4-count inhale, chin lock and 4-count hold, 8-count exhale (after releasing chin lock).
9. 10 rounds of 10 pelvic floor contractions.

**When possible, I did the following throughout the workday:**

1. Rock back breathing (5-count), 10 cat-cows, and upward-facing dog; once.
2. 10 cat-cows and upward-facing dog; twice.
3. Wall breathing; 10 breaths. (Usually right after number 1.)
4. 15 single-leg calf raises; both sides, 3 times.
5. Pectoral corner stretches; 10 breaths. (Usually right after number 4.)
6. Single arm wall press, hand down. (Usually right after number 5.)
7. Couch quad stretches; 10 breaths, both sides, 3 times. (Usually after number 6.)

This allows me to create 3 pretty solid rounds, starting with the cat-cow and couch quad stretch. And I just do three rounds to two per day.

I’ve decided to try and do the week 1 day 1 warmup from the MovNat Fundamentals course on Mondays. It went pretty well.

## Thursday, August 4 to Monday, August 6, 2023

Decided to take a couple of recovery days, so not much going on or of note.

## Thursday, August 3, 2023

WHOOP said this was my first day of reaching over 90 percent recovery. 

I knew I would be seeing my [physical therapist](https://www.instagram.com/theunbrokenacademy/), and I didn't do a full-on set because I didn't want to be any more messed up when I saw her.

We talked about the exercises I felt I was adapting to and my realization regarding my left leg.

My left leg wasn't getting the memo in the same way my right leg was. During the transverse planar slouch, my right leg would start by overusing the groin and hip flexors; however, it would eventually key in the glutes and outside of the hamstring area. Meanwhile, my left leg never shifted away from the groin and hip flexors. During the inverted wall press, everything in my body felt like it was just another day at the beach, except the back of my left knee, which always felt like it was trying to stretch. During the calf raises, I noticed that my left calf wasn't contributing as much to the overall effort.

I told her about the pain in my hands and feet. She confirmed that was weird, but not to the point of extra concern.

In short, the leg that passed the movement tests with flying colors seems like it managed to do so because of various layers of compensations, not by using the muscles it was supposed to.

Modifications were made:

1. Single-leg calf raises instead of calf raises while holding the ball. Start with the left leg, and repeat the same number of reps with the right leg.
2. Single arm wall press with hand down to try and elongate the muscles in my forearm.
3. We moved from rock back breathing on the ground to wall breathing, still emphasizing breathing into and expanding the back of the ribcage.

## Wednesday, August 2, 2023

I've added walking a mile in the morning to my routine. This is to replicate the walking to an office building I used to do. When walking to an office, it would have counted as passive exercise. Since walking now is for its own sake, it's considered active exercise.

I also increased my water intake to about 1 ounce per pound of body weight.

The last two days were pretty intense regarding body transformation and adaptation. I went to bed around 7 pm. I was wide awake at midnight. I lay in bed and meditated mainly, trying to be as relaxed as possible. The [WHOOP](/examinations/whoop-health-monitor/) showed me as asleep most of that time. 

I did the 1-mile walk in the morning. Took a nap. I did all my physical therapy exercises and additional components from the [MovNat](https://www.movnat.com) week 1 day 1 workout; just some warmup movements.

## Tuesday, August 1, 2023

Felt like I slept well. I was able to do all the physical therapy things. 

- No stiffness
- Low-grade discomfort and pain similar to the previous day.

This was my second day doing the vagal nerve stimulation and pelvic floor exercises.
