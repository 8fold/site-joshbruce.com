Tested positive for COVID for the first time.

The first weekend of August, Becca and I went down to Nashville to help a friend paint their house. On the second our friend wasn’t feeling well, but was chalking it up to sinuses and not having a lot of ventilation.

Becca and I returned to Louisville on Sunday afternoon. Tuesday evening our friend sent a text letting us know that they tested positive. Becca was going to wait until Wednesday morning to take a home test, and I decided to take mine Tuesday night, which would give us a bit of a stagger between tests.

I was about to step outside for a cigarette, but took the time to start the test. Before I stepped outside, the positive line was already starting to show.

I set up the air mattress in the second room.

You might be thinking, “You don’t need to isolate at that point,” and you do you. This is what we decided, and did so prior to either of us getting COVID.

That night [WHOOP](/examinations/whoop-health-monitor/) had me at a level 3 strain pretty much the entire night. Wednesday I was in a level 3 strain almost the entire day. I took multiple naps and ate ramen because it would be easy to digest and helpful.

Funny thing is, I didn’t have any of the common symptoms. Even though I took multiple naps, I did it mainly out of boredom, This.

Thursday was pretty much the same. Friday I spent a bit more time in level 2 strain. Saturday I dropped into level 1 a few times, but spent most of the time in levels 2 and 3.

My recovery scores for the same period was 7, 15, 2, and 1 respectively.

WHOOP also measures 5 health metrics regularly:

1. respiratory rate,
2. blood oxygen,
3. resting heart rate,
4. heart rate variability, and
5. skin temperature.

Every one of these except blood oxygen were outside of normal ranges for me.

Sunday I shot back up to a yellow recovery (64 percent). This was followed by 5 green recoveries (all above 70 percent) in a row.

I finally tested negative on Wednesday. My highest known fever was 101 degrees Fahrenheit. I did not come and stay out of isolation until testing negative.

Given I spent so much time in bed, I was expecting some fatigue and loss of stamina. So, I’ve been taking it a bit slow.

I started with going back to my full meals and the system integrity check. Wake up, do the thing and eat the food (mostly standing), take a nap. Maybe do something else from the list, take a nap. That sort of stuff.

There were a couple of days of all the mucus a sputum clearing; similar to when I have sinus issues.

Outside of that, I don’t think I’m experiencing any of the normal COVID or long COVID things.

In other news, the toenail on my left big toe is continuing to flatten out. The right big toenail is doing the same, and seems to have recovered from the severe ingrown deal I had a while back. Still working on the fungus, I think.
