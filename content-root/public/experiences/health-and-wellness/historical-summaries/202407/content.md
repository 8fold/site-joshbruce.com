Haven’t experienced anymore collapses. 

Feeling really good all around. [.Magnetic Resonance Imaging](MRI) didn’t show anything unusual. [.Electrocardiogram](EKG) was also fine.

So, we’re chalking it up to [vasovagal syncope](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vasovagal-syncope/symptoms-causes/syc-20350527).

I decided to get the [HPV vaccine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/HPV_vaccine) given this is the final year I can do that. It might be overkill as the CDC says most folks 26 or older have been exposed; however, I don’t tend to appreciate this line of thinking as it’s not verified (or verifiable in some cases). None of my current or previous partners, to the best of my knowledge have tested positive for HPV. As a male, I can’t be tested. And, near as I can tell, there’s not an antibody test. The vaccine is good for 5–10 years. So, if nothing else, hoping to raise awareness and maintain demand, because capitalism or not, humans are a use it or lose it species.
