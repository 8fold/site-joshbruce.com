Becca and I are traveling.

We started from Louisville on July 3rd. We stayed at an Airbnb in Columbus with Katrina until the 8th. We did an overnight in Cleveland before heading into Toronto for another overnight. We stayed overnight in [1,000 Islands](https://visit1000islands.com) before heading to Montreal for Mysterium. We'll head from here to New York, then West Virginia, before returning to Louisville.

I'm physically feeling pretty amazing. I need to keep an eye on my sweating and electrolyte intake. I'm also appreciating Canada a great deal. 

Both of my big toenails are continuing to flatten out. Having said that, the toenails on the big toe, along with the second and third digits on my right foot, are pretty misshapen. I'm hoping it's mainly caused by any fungus freaking out and splitting the toenail along the layers.

I haven’t experienced any more collapses. 

Feeling good all around. [.Magnetic Resonance Imaging](MRI) didn’t show anything unusual. [.Electrocardiogram](EKG) was also fine.

So, we’re chalking it up to [vasovagal syncope](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vasovagal-syncope/symptoms-causes/syc-20350527).

I decided to get the [HPV vaccine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/HPV_vaccine), given this is the final year I can do that. It might be overkill as the CDC says most folks 26 or older have been exposed; however, I don’t tend to appreciate this line of thinking as it’s not verified (or verifiable in some cases). None of my current or previous partners, to the best of my knowledge, have tested positive for HPV. As a male, I can’t be tested. And, as far as I can tell, there’s no antibody test. The vaccine is good for 5–10 years. So, if nothing else, I am hoping to raise awareness and maintain demand because, capitalism or not, humans are a use-it-or lose-it species.
