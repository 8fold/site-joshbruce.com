Physically I’m doing pretty well. No pain. Having said that, I did experience some bleeding from by belly button. This sorta thing happens every few years actually. I’m not sure what it is and never brought up to a medical professional until this time.

My primary care was great. He listed off a bunch of things it could be; including a couple of things that are so rare only a few reported cases exist. By “a few” I mean less than 20. Did a CT scan to rule out most of them. So, we’re thinking it’s a cyst or similar that popped. He told me to apply an over the counter antibiotic cream using a cotton swab.

It’s better now.

Mentally I’m doing pretty well. Taking this time to decompress, de-pickle, and work on some of the independent projects that were on hold while working full-time gigs is helpful. Granted, I still have days where the brain gremlins creep in and tell me no one will but the products and services I’m putting out there. But, I’m giving it a shot.

Emotionally I’m doing fantastic. I practice [polyamory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyamory) and recently met my second romantic partner; it’s been about 7 years since I had more than one. I’ve also been building community through [The Rotation](/experiences/the-system/#the-rotation), which has been going very well. Part of that is due to the acceptance folks have had regarding the news (to them), that I’m ethically non-monogamous.

Right now there are about 40 people I have listed on The Rotation. Some folks are being pushed to longer periods between catch-up calls, while others are getting shorter. I’m thinking about scaling some folks back to text messages just because they don’t seem interested in calling, but appreciate text-based conversations on occasion.
