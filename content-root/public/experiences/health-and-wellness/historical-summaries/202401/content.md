Winter is upon us and my toes aren’t happy about it.

A few days ago, my feet got wet. Over the next couple of days I started getting a burning sensation at the tips of my big toe and second digit on my right foot. I believe yesterday it went into [dactylitis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dactylitis) territory. The pain got to the point that I took a Non-Steroid Anti-Inflammatory Drug. It seemed to help.

Still hurts a little today.

I don’t think we can classify it as inflammatory arthritis at this point because I didn’t experience any stiffness or pain the joints. Just the swelling and surface burning sensation.

I also had my phone worked on, which reset the [MacroFactor](/examinations/macrofactor-food-tracker/) app. It’s still in recalibration mode and I’m not making changes to my diet. I changed the check-in day to be Sunday as that’s usually my full fasting day. That means any shifts to the plan shouldn’t cause any mild-to-severe dietary shifts.

Regarding the system integrity check I do in the morning, winter has made it more difficult to take showers long enough to do the full version. That said, I think the bare bones variation I’m coming to is the seated series up to and including the hand releases.

Beyond that, I think the body is doing okay and I think I’m settling in on some decent workflows for all things beyond the physical.

I’m trying out only doing writing on the weekdays in the hopes of making time for more laid back weekends. I still have things slated for those days, but it’s more about maintenance, infrastructure, and laid back things.

I don’t like the idea of adding ads (and especially not trackers) to this site. In part because it will degrade the performance and user experience, but mainly because I don’t want to participate in the ad-based revenue model of the Internet.

As such, I am considering adding calls to action for the things I’m making. I’m also looking at increasing the prominence of the crowdfunding links. Lastly I already somewhat participate in affiliate marketing (the [WHOOP article](/examinations/whoop-health-monitor/), which is a referral link).

The problem with the affiliate or referral linking is that I don’t own or buy a lot of products or services and would only want to link to products and services I actively use.

Anyway, even though I didn’t make it to my first Coast-FI number in 2023, it was a few months behind and I’m currently not making enough revenue to continue contributing. But this isn’t that series.

My phone was having battery issues. So, I took it to Apple for service. Went off without a hitch thanks to AppleCare. I don’t usually recommend device insurance, but for Apple products, I’m pretty much all in.

The [WHOOP](https://joshbruce.com/examinations/whoop-health-monitor/) needed to be reconnected. That went relatively smoothly. The [MacroFactor app](https://joshbruce.com/examinations/macrofactor-food-tracker/) on the other hand, not as much; effectively starting over there. Not that big of a deal, more annoying than anything else.

All right, health stuff, right. 

The right big toenail is definitely growing out whatever funkiness was all up in there. The top part of the nail is a distinctly different color than the lower part. Looks like about a quarter of the nail still needs to grow out and be cut off. But that bottom portion is a nice color and texture similar to its brethren.

The right second digit nail is still funky. Like hella funky. I think it was actually the progenitor of whatever fungus overtook the big toe. 

The left big toenail seems to be liking no longer being curled as much and it seems to coming well-attached to the toe itself.

I haven’t been doing much in the way of physical activity. I’m trying to see what gives me the most bang for the buck. So far, the seated portion of the system integrity check seems like a keeper.

I’m also really focusing on setting up a more sustainable rhythm with all the other things.

My left arm hurts a bit. I’m thinking that’s from not doing the wall presses. My right leg has also been giving me problems.

I did an experiment of not doing anything for about a week, and my hips were not appreciating that. When I started doing the seated activities for the morning system integrity check, it started getting better, which leads me to believe it was the cause.

Beyond that, doing okay and the hypotheses are proving accurate and fruitful.

I think I’m going to shift to publishing these on or near Friday instead of Sunday.

I think the [MacroFactor app](/examinations/macrofactor-food-tracker/) is settling in. MacroFactor uses body weight and trends to calculate caloric expenditure. Since [December 25th](/experiences/health-and-wellness/historical-summaries/202312/#sunday-december-24-2023), I’ve had 9 weigh-ins; 8 of them have been at 220 pounds. Further, in that time, the target caloric intake has stayed around 3,500 calories.

It’s winter, I’m unemployed, and working on a fair amount of side projects.

Winter means I’m walking less, and feeling a bit disappointed that I’m not using the treadmill I purchased. Unemployed means I’m looking for (or at least for) a steady stream of income; taking opportunities when they present themselves, while taking advantage of the somewhat [privileged position](/experiences/finances/paycheck-to-paycheck/) I’ve set up for myself. I’m pumping a lot of time and energy into the side projects, specifically the long-tail ones.

Beyond that, I’m starting to dial in a sustainable pace. Further, the activities I’m choosing and that cadence are such that I still have space for full-time employment when that becomes an option.

This dialing in includes finding the activities that deliver the most band for the time taken (return on investment) from a health and wellness perspective.

Oh, and the great toenail uncurling is still a work-in-progress, but seems to be going well.

Today is “book day” according to Becca. (I love her a great deal.) I released the free sample chapter for *[Time: Mastering the Mundane](https://leanpub.com/master-the-mundane)*. The plan is to publish a Part every week. I’m thinking the free download will have Parts 1 & 2. Then, in exchange for reader’s email address they can get the “Community Edition,” which will include Part 3. Once I get Part 4 published in the full version, I’ll open it to purchasing. And that will keep going until I run out of Parts to publish. Then I’ll open it up to mass-distribution.

But, that’s more mental and financial health, let’s get to physical health.

I’m doing pretty good physically. Still experimenting with things.

From a nutrition perspective, I’ve definitely found food combinations and types that maximize flexibility to reach the nutritional goals.

The first two digits of my right foot aren’t happy at the moment. The big toe isn’t liking the toenail establishing the groove and I’m experiencing pressure pains as it’s coming back in; at least I hope it’s only pressure pains. The second digit is experiencing something similar, but it’s a smaller nail. The nail layers are still separated, making it look thicker than its relatives. Still using the anti-fungal lacquer. Im hoping some of the pain I’m experiencing is just any and all fungus working itself out.

It’s cold and I’m not walking as much or as often. I have the treadmill as well, but I’m not prioritizing physical movement right now because I’m a productivity super-freak with a new toy; writing and publishing books. I’m also recalibrating the morning system integrity check to see how I can get it below 2 hours, or maybe only do some of it every other day while not sliding back.

Beyond that, the non-vegetarian experiments continue to indicate that my body doesn’t do well with animal products. Near as I can tell, from most to least negative impact:

1. dairy,
2. processed grains and greasy foods, and
3. meat.

The [WHOOP](https://joshbruce.com/examinations/whoop-health-monitor/) doesn’t look at dairy or grains as part of its integration with the food tracking app; so, no confirmation there. However, the data do indicate fruits and vegetables contribute to an 8 percent increase in my recovery score. Meanwhile, meat has a negative 3 percent impact.

I also did update the manual journaling points for dairy, vegetarian diet, and gluten free diet.
