My phone was having battery issues. So, I took it to Apple for service. Went off without a hitch thanks to AppleCare. I don’t usually recommend device insurance, but for Apple products, I’m pretty much all in.

The [WHOOP](https://joshbruce.com/examinations/whoop-health-monitor/) needed to be reconnected. That went relatively smoothly. The [MacroFactor app](https://joshbruce.com/examinations/macrofactor-food-tracker/) on the other hand, not as much; effectively starting over there. Not that big of a deal, more annoying than anything else.

All right, health stuff, right. 

The right big toenail is definitely growing out whatever funkiness was all up in there. The top part of the nail is a distinctly different color than the lower part. Looks like about a quarter of the nail still needs to grow out and be cut off. But that bottom portion is a nice color and texture similar to its brethren.

The right second digit nail is still funky. Like hella funky. I think it was actually the progenitor of whatever fungus overtook the big toe. 

The left big toenail seems to be liking no longer being curled as much and it seems to coming well-attached to the toe itself.

I haven’t been doing much in the way of physical activity. I’m trying to see what gives me the most bang for the buck. So far, the seated portion of the system integrity check seems like a keeper.

I’m also really focusing on setting up a more sustainable rhythm with all the other things.

My left arm hurts a bit. I’m thinking that’s from not doing the wall presses. My right leg has also been giving me problems.

I did an experiment of not doing anything for about a week, and my hips were not appreciating that. When I started doing the seated activities for the morning system integrity check, it started getting better, which leads me to believe it was the cause.

Beyond that, doing okay and the hypotheses are proving accurate and fruitful.

I think I’m going to shift to publishing these on or near Friday instead of Sunday.

I think the [MacroFactor app](/examinations/macrofactor-food-tracker/) is settling in. MacroFactor uses body weight and trends to calculate caloric expenditure. Since [December 25th](/experiences/health-and-wellness/historical-summaries/202312/#sunday-december-24-2023), I’ve had 9 weigh-ins; 8 of them have been at 220 pounds. Further, in that time, the target caloric intake has stayed around 3,500 calories.

It’s winter, I’m unemployed, and working on a fair amount of side projects.

Winter means I’m walking less, and feeling a bit disappointed that I’m not using the treadmill I purchased. Unemployed means I’m looking for (or at least for) a steady stream of income; taking opportunities when they present themselves, while taking advantage of the somewhat [privileged position](/experiences/finances/paycheck-to-paycheck/) I’ve set up for myself. I’m pumping a lot of time and energy into the side projects, specifically the long-tail ones.

Beyond that, I’m starting to dial in a sustainable pace. Further, the activities I’m choosing and that cadence are such that I still have space for full-time employment when that becomes an option.

This dialing in includes finding the activities that deliver the most band for the time taken (return on investment) from a health and wellness perspective.

Oh, and the great toenail uncurling is still a work-in-progress, but seems to be going well.

Today is “book day” according to Becca. (I love her a great deal.) I released the free sample chapter for *[Time: Mastering the Mundane](https://leanpub.com/master-the-mundane)*. The plan is to publish a Part every week. I’m thinking the free download will have Parts 1 & 2. Then, in exchange for reader’s email address they can get the “Community Edition,” which will include Part 3. Once I get Part 4 published in the full version, I’ll open it to purchasing. And that will keep going until I run out of Parts to publish. Then I’ll open it up to mass-distribution.

But, that’s more mental and financial health, let’s get to physical health.

I’m doing pretty good physically. Still experimenting with things.

From a nutrition perspective, I’ve definitely found food combinations and types that maximize flexibility to reach the nutritional goals.

The first two digits of my right foot aren’t happy at the moment. The big toe isn’t liking the toenail establishing the groove and I’m experiencing pressure pains as it’s coming back in; at least I hope it’s only pressure pains. The second digit is experiencing something similar, but it’s a smaller nail. The nail layers are still separated, making it look thicker than its relatives. Still using the anti-fungal lacquer. Im hoping some of the pain I’m experiencing is just any and all fungus working itself out.

It’s cold and I’m not walking as much or as often. I have the treadmill as well, but I’m not prioritizing physical movement right now because I’m a productivity super-freak with a new toy; writing and publishing books. I’m also recalibrating the morning system integrity check to see how I can get it below 2 hours, or maybe only do some of it every other day while not sliding back.

Beyond that, the non-vegetarian experiments continue to indicate that my body doesn’t do well with animal products. Near as I can tell, from most to least negative impact:

1. dairy,
2. processed grains and greasy foods, and
3. meat.

The [WHOOP](https://joshbruce.com/examinations/whoop-health-monitor/) doesn’t look at dairy or grains as part of its integration with the food tracking app; so, no confirmation there. However, the data do indicate fruits and vegetables contribute to an 8 percent increase in my recovery score. Meanwhile, meat has a negative 3 percent impact.

I also did update the manual journaling points for dairy, vegetarian diet, and gluten free diet.
