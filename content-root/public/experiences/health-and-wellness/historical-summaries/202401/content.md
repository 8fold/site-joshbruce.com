Today is “book day” according to Becca. (I love her a great deal.) I released the free sample chapter for *[Time: Mastering the Mundane](https://leanpub.com/master-the-mundane)*. The plan is to publish a Part every week. I’m thinking the free download will have Parts 1 & 2. Then, in exchange for reader’s email address they can get the “Community Edition,” which will include Part 3. Once I get Part 4 published in the full version, I’ll open it to purchasing. And that will keep going until I run out of Parts to publish. Then I’ll open it up to mass-distribution.

But, that’s more mental and financial health, let’s get to physical health.

I’m doing pretty good physically. Still experimenting with things.

From a nutrition perspective, I’ve definitely found food combinations and types that maximize flexibility to reach the nutritional goals.

The first two digits of my right foot aren’t happy at the moment. The big toe isn’t liking the toenail establishing the groove and I’m experiencing pressure pains as it’s coming back in; at least I hope it’s only pressure pains. The second digit is experiencing something similar, but it’s a smaller nail. The nail layers are still separated, making it look thicker than its relatives. Still using the anti-fungal lacquer. Im hoping some of the pain I’m experiencing is just any and all fungus working itself out.

It’s cold and I’m not walking as much or as often. I have the treadmill as well, but I’m not prioritizing physical movement right now because I’m a productivity super-freak with a new toy; writing and publishing books. I’m also recalibrating the morning system integrity check to see how I can get it below 2 hours, or maybe only do some of it every other day while not sliding back.

Beyond that, the non-vegetarian experiments continue to indicate that my body doesn’t do well with animal products. Near as I can tell, from most to least negative impact:

1. dairy,
2. processed grains and greasy foods, and
3. meat.

The [WHOOP](https://joshbruce.com/examinations/whoop-health-monitor/) doesn’t look at dairy or grains as part of its integration with the food tracking app; so, no confirmation there. However, the data do indicate fruits and vegetables contribute to an 8 percent increase in my recovery score. Meanwhile, meat has a negative 3 percent impact.

I also did update the manual journaling points for dairy, vegetarian diet, and gluten free diet.
