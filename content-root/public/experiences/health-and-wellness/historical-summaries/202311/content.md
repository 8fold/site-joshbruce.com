The experiments with nutrition are doing well. I have made it more flexible and require less actual cooking. Let's break it down:

- Breakfast
	- 150 grams of sunflower seeds
	- 100 grams of peanuts, which I may not be keeping
	- 3 large eggs
	- 20 ounces of orange juice
	- Banana smoothie:
		- 200 grams of bananas
		- 2 scoops of a bovine collagen powder
		- 6 grams of creatine
		- 1 tablespoon of honey
		- 25 grams of chia seeds
		- 13 fluid ounces of water
- Dinner
	- 12 ounces of green peas
	- 2 Protein bars
	- Fruit smoothie:
		- 75 grams of blueberries
		- 75 grams of blackberries
		- 75 grams of cherries
		- 28 grams of pea protein
		- 1 tablespoon of honey
		- 25 grams of chia seeds
		- 15 fluid ounces of water

Breaking it down using the [MacroFactor app](/examinations/macrofactor-food-tracker/), we have the following macronutrient profile (rough numbers):

-  3,700 calories
-  196 grams of protein
-  196 grams of fat
-  405 grams of carbohydrates

My estimated daily caloric burn is hovering between 3,000 and 4,000. This is without doing much in the way of physical exercise. 

From a micronutrient perspective, the highest contributors are the nuts, seeds, protein bars, and orange juice. This should set me up for success while traveling as I can pack and supplement most of these things with other things on the road. 

Work was getting interesting in a bad way, and I decided to leave that position to focus on some other things. 

I've started working on some of the books I've been putting off and refining my productivity system to improve my mental health, not that it was in a critical position or anything, just a lot of weight being carried. Now that nutrition is more stable, I've started ramping up on physical therapy and fitness.

Oh, and this will be the last week with eggs. I've also noticed some irritated skin problems on my face I used to get back in the day. I think the peanuts are a contributing factor and have switched them back out for pumpkin seeds as I didn't experience the problem while using those.
