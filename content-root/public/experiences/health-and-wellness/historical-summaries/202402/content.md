Not much to report this week.

I'm thinking I'm going to shift the cadence of these to *at least* once every two weeks; instead of weekly. It was one thing when there was a lot happening and a lot changing with the body, but less volatility and less to report.

So, I'll post more often if something happens, but, yeah, switching to at least every two weeks.

The two problem toenails on the right foot have been pretty yellow the last couple of days. I went ahead and ran a buffer block over the nails to try and increase permeability. Then I applied the anti-fungal lacquer. It's interesting because the nail mycosis solution seemed to be the thing that hit the right big toenail the most but didn't do much for the second digit. Meanwhile, the lacquer seems to be causing the most notable changes to the second digit on the right foot.

My hips are a bit painful, specifically in the hip flexor area. I've spent an hour or two the last couple of days sitting in a normal chair. I'm not sure if the pain is from standing incorrectly (I don't think so), from sitting (possible), from not doing the system integrity check for a couple of days (also likely), or a combination (most probable).

I'm also running an experiment regarding peanut food sensitivity. I replaced pumpkin seeds with peanuts recently because they're cheaper. I noticed the rosacea appearing on my face again. The grocery store was out of the protein bars I normally get, so I switched to a peanut butter one. The rosacea got worse. It seems to be stable for the moment.

I'll finish out this bag of peanuts, then switch back to pumpkin seeds. I also bought a one-pound bag of peanuts to give me some wiggle room to experiment. That experiment will be to have pumpkin seeds and peanuts and see if it might actually be the sunflower seeds that are the primary driver.
