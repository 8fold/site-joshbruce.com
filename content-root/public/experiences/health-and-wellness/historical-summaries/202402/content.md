[WHOOP](/examinations/whoop-health-monitor/) has been showing mainly green on the recovery score for the last couple of weeks. I did end up with a single red day thrown in for good measure.

So far, the data point to the days when I deviate from the normal diet I've set myself on. For example, this morning's recovery was on the high end of a yellow recovery. Yesterday I didn't have my normal last meal. Instead of the fruit smoothie, pumpkin seeds, and protein bar, I had seafood salad and crackers. Prior to that, all days were green. Not high green, but green nonetheless.

Beyond that, things are moving right along. I'm feeling pretty good mentally, physically, and emotionally. I'm going to start incorporating more fitness into the mix again.

A few weeks ago, I needed to get my phone worked on. Doing so reset the [MacroFactor](/examinations/macrofactor-food-tracker/) app. My weight has remained stable, which is how MaacroFactor calculates caloric needs. I've started doing the morning system integrity check consistently again, which I think is helping with the green recoveries, and WHOOP insights seem to agree. I'm going to see about ramping up on fitness things again as well.

I've also fleshed out a bit more of the [Mastering the Mundane website](https://mastering-the-mundane.com) to include mentoring and other services.

I'm also still passively looking for regular employment.

This is going to be the [change-step](https://youtu.be/exPY2TdJ_GQ) post. We'll be switching to the every two weeks cadence for these.

Two days in a row were red recovery days according to [WHOOP](/examinations/whoop-health-monitor/). Those were followed by a couple of days in a row of green recovery. Last night was a yellow recovery. 64 percent, which is 3 percent too low for another green day.

The seeds and nuts experiment is shifting a bit, I think. I'll keep going down the peanuts and sunflower seeds path until I run out of the 5-pound bag of peanuts. Then, I'll shift to pumpkin seeds and sunflower seeds to see what happens with the rosacea. I have a 1-pound bag of peanuts as well, which means I can alternate days there.

Not much to report this week.

I think I'll shift the cadence of these to *at least* once every two weeks instead of weekly. It was one thing when a lot was happening and changing with the body, but less volatility and less to report doesn't make much sense.

I'll post more often if something happens, but yeah, I'm switching to at least every two weeks.

The two problem toenails on the right foot have been pretty yellow the last couple of days. I ran a buffer block over the nails to try and increase permeability. Then, I applied the anti-fungal lacquer. It's interesting because the nail mycosis solution was the thing that hit the right big toenail the most but didn't do much for the second digit. Meanwhile, the lacquer seems to be causing the most notable changes to the second digit on the right foot.

My hips are a bit painful, specifically in the hip flexor area. I've spent an hour or two the last few days sitting in a regular chair. I don't know if the pain is from standing incorrectly (I don't think so), from sitting (possible), from not doing the system integrity check for a couple of days (also likely), or a combination (most probable).

I'm also running an experiment regarding peanut food sensitivity. I replaced pumpkin seeds with peanuts recently because they're cheaper. I noticed the rosacea appearing on my face again. The grocery store was out of the protein bars I usually get, so I switched to a peanut butter one. The rosacea got worse. It seems to be stable for the moment.

I'll finish this bag of peanuts, then switch back to pumpkin seeds. I also bought a one-pound bag of peanuts to give me some wiggle room to experiment. That experiment will have pumpkin seeds and peanuts and see if the sunflower seeds are the primary driver.
