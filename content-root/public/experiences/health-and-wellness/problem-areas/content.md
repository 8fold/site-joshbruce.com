# Problem areas

The following details are offered as a central repository to make journaling easier.

I'll use the [unidimensional verbal pain scale](https://pressbooks.library.torontomu.ca/assessmentnursing2/chapter/unidimensional-pain-assessment-tools/):

- **None:** Positive impact on quality of life.
- **Mild:** Limited negative impact on quality of life.
- **Moderate:** Greater impact on quality of life, but still manageable without medication or surgery.
- **Severe:** Greatest impact on quality of life, and only medication or surgery seems to help.

**Injuries**

- 2011 severe sprain of right ankle
- 2012 blunt force trauma of the top of left foot

**Surgeries**

- 2022 appendectomy

**Procedures**

- 2019 vasectomy
- 2022 removal of an ingrown toenail on the right hallux

## Right knee

**Mild**

The knee is a bit stiff, and slight pain is present.

Movement helps.

**Moderate**

Same as mild only pain increases when weight-bearing and confidence in the knee's stability is reduced; moving with caution.

Movement helps.

## Right ankle

**Mild**

Awareness has been present since May 2023.



## Right, left, or both feet—bottom

**Moderate**

Awareness has been present since May 2023.

Moving into a standing position causes pain, however, subsides as muscles relax.

## Right foot—the great toe

**Mild**

Awareness has been present since 2022.

Limited range of motion in the first joint when moving the toe into dorsiflexion.

**Moderate**

First appeared around July 2022.

Pain is present in the first joint when moving the toe into dorsiflexion—mild pain when massaging the joint or moving the toe into adduction (manually or on its own)—little-to-no pain in a neutral position.

Movement, such as walking, helps.

**Severe**

First appeared around September 2022.

Moderate symptoms are present. The toe is swollen; no heat, not sensitive to touch. Affects the ability to walk.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs help.

## Right foot—top of the foot

**Mild**

First appeared roughly May 2023.

Possible correlating event: Toe abductions as part of the exercise list.

Pain is present across the soft tissue over the metatarsals of the second through fifth digit when moving toes into dorsiflexion.

Pain doesn't exist while in a neutral position.

## Left foot—hallux

**Mild**

Awareness has been present since 2022.

Mild pain when moving the toe into dorsiflexion.

## Left foot—long toe

**Mild**

Awareness has been present since 2022.

Development of hammer toe. Limited range of motion at the second joint when in dorsiflexion.

Calf stretches and stretching the toe specifically help.

**Moderate**

First appeared around July 2023.

Pain on the bottom of the foot, specifically at the first joint of the long toe (possible [capsulitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsulitis)). 

When not load-bearing, no pain is present. 

Massage and stretching seem to help, however, are accompanied by discoloration and potentially severe pain.

## Neck—anterior triangle

**Mild**

Awareness has been present since May 2023.

Neck extension becomes limited by this area of the neck.

**Moderate**

First appeared around July 25th, 2023.

Neck extension causes pain throughout this area of the neck.

## Left, right, or both wrists

**Moderate**

First presented in July 2023.

Limited range of motion, crispy-crunchy movement, and pain at the end of the range of motion.

**Severe**

Same as moderate, only pain is present even in a neutral position, and the wrist may feel "locked" in place.

## Left hand—middle finger

**Mild**

Awareness has been present since June 2023.

No pain in the neutral position or when abduction and adduction are performed manually (no participation of finger). Mild discomfort when moving into flexion, abduction, and adduction. Abduction and adduction pain is at a constant level, while flexion is a linear increase in severity.

Pain is located on the posterior and sides of the first phalange of the finger.

Massage and manual adjustment offer temporary relief lasting anywhere from a few seconds to a few hours. Massage is between the metacarpals, along the posterior of the metacarpal and first phalange, and the extensors in the forearm.

**Moderate**

Started in July 2023.

Same as mild, only the pain is more severe.

**Severe**

Started on July 20, 2023.

Same as moderate; however, the intensity of flexion starts earlier. For example, typing causes sharp pain at a level felt at the far end of flexion during a moderate case.

## Left-hand index finger

**Mild**

Awareness has been present since June 2023.

Mild pain is present along the thumb side of the index finger, mainly when the index finger needs to be engaged for support, like holding the handle of a pan with the thumb on top of the handle and the second joint of the index finger on the bottom of the handle.

## Upper thoracic spine (mid-back)

**Mild**

Started in February 2023.

It's an odd feeling. It doesn't feel like traditional muscle soreness. Instead, it feels like a strain or sprain of soft tissue.

## Lower thoracic spine (mid-back)

**Mild**

Started in July 2023.

Muscle soreness mainly. The soreness spreads completely across the back. It's similar to having a tense muscle that should be tense.

**Moderate**

This area of the back feels like it will start cramping any moment; usually happens with added strain.

## Lumbar spine (low-back)

**Mild**

Started in July 2023.

Muscle soreness mainly. The soreness spreads completely across the back and is roughly the width of the lumbar spine.
