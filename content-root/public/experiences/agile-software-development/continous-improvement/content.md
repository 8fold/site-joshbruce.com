# Continuous improvement

{!! dateblock !!}

Continuous improvement is the idea of continuously seeking to better the circumstances of an individual, group, or object. This, of course, presumes that it's never perfect and, in some interpretations, that "good enough" is never, in fact, good enough.

In the Agile Software Development space, we tend to push ourselves and others to strive for this continuous improvement idea in practice. 

There's a dichotomy here. 

I remember in 2020, when the Coronavirus first started spreading, and we went into lockdown. One of the popular refrains was that if you didn't come out of lockdown with a new or improved skill, you wasted that opportunity. Then, a counterpoint came into popularity, which was that "It's okay if you don't improve. We're all going through some shit right now. Calm down and deal with what's happening."

So much negative baggage can reside around this idea. At what point do we take a break or, put another way, continue practicing inside the plateau? Further, how much improvement needs to happen before we consider it an improvement? Finally, does the law of diminishing returns not apply to improving things?

Practicing in the plateau alludes to the concept of mastery and mastery curves. The observation here is that whenever we first start something, there is a period of very little progress, then a spike, followed by a small dip, followed by a plateau (or leveling off) that will last for an indeterminate amount of time. From a continuous improvement perspective, we might view the plateau as a problem that needs to be addressed instead of a natural part of the cycle. Further, we may be focused on a granular item within a larger discipline or practice—how much weight you can squat versus how far you can run—both are within the fitness discipline; however, they aren't the same thing.

I recently started discussing my [health and wellness](/experiences/health-and-wellness/) issues and journey. Last month I made the observation that I wasn't walking as much as I did the last time I felt relatively healthy and fit. 

So, I added a 1-mile walk to my morning routine to reclaim something I lost when I started working from home (a 1 percent improvement, so to speak). That first week I was sweating a lot, and my calves achieved a consistent level of discomfort; my ability to recover was maintaining the same pace as the stress placed on them. Toward the end of the week, my calves were feeling better, and I wasn't sweating as much with the walk. I added a second 1-mile walk to my evening (a 1 percent improvement). The next week I felt better and increased the morning walk to 2 miles (a 1 percent improvement). The next week I felt better and increased the evening walk to 2 miles (a 1 percent improvement).

I also walk to get groceries every week. That walk is about 4 miles. I added a mile to that walk (a 1 percent improvement), making it a 5-mile walk, with roughly 1 mile it carrying an extra 10 to 20 pounds. And, I recently just made walking at least 4 miles per day to my day. 

Does adding a day of 4 miles count as a 1 percent improvement or a 20 percent improvement?

I appreciate the sentiment of the following:

> 100 1 percent improvements is the same as 1 100 percent improvement.

This plays into [the principle](/experiences/the-self/#principles) that:

> Great value doesn't require grand gestures.







These intentional distances, along with my non-exercise activities, bring me to about 10,000 steps per day (the merits of [10,000 steps as a target can be argued](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/10000-steps-a-day-or-fewer-2019071117305)); the step count wasn't intentional, it's incidental to the actual desire of mimicking walking to and from an office each day.




I sent a message out to some folks recently. It started with the following line:

> 100 1 percent improvements is the same as 1 100 percent improvement.

We'll talk about the bad rap of continuous improvement later, but for now, let's look at a practical example, my . If you don't know the backstory, the short version is that in the middle of 2022, I asked my primary care physician if they thought I could increase my activity level; they said yes. What followed was a series of injuries and illnesses.

It's worth noting that it's not like I ran out and joined a rugby team. My goal at the time was to do the following every day:

1. a one-minute plank,
2. a regular push-up,
3. an inverted row, and
4. an air squat.

In early 2023 I revisited this goal and experienced the same problems I had in 2022. Same problems. I deemed this unacceptable and started a journey to improve my condition and try to pinpoint what was happening; "Getting old" wasn't a valid response. Over the course of a couple of months, things have been improving; I still haven't tried the goals listed above.

One thing I realized about how my lifestyle had changed since 2020 was that I was no longer walking a mile to 2 to an office daily. So, I started walking to mimic walking to and from an office. Given how active I was prior to 2020 and how poorly my body responded to something as scaled back as the list above, I wasn't about to just start walking 4 miles a day (2 miles to the fake office and back). Instead, I went for the smallest change that could make me feel like I had accomplished something; 1 mile every day for a week without injury or pain.

I did it (1 percent improvement). The next week I added another mile walk in the evening (1 percent improvement). I added another mile to the morning walk the next week, making it 2 miles (1 percent improvement). I added another mile to the evening walk the next week, making it 2 miles (1 percent improvement). 

Overall, it was a 4 times improvement compared to how much walking per day I would get from just being me. The first week I was sweating like crazy, and my calves started to experience a little discomfort toward the end of the week. But I didn't feel bad and was feeling pretty good; the [WHOOP](/examinations/whoop-health-monitor/) told me so.

I was also doing prescribed exercises from a physical therapist. At first, I could barely get through them, so I scaled them back. I knew what the goal was—finish the prescription every day. But, I set myself weekly targets to reach to monitor discomfort, pain, and injury.

I also purchased courses to add an external movement (exercise) practice. At first, I couldn't make it through the warm-up; that became the goal. I started doing stretches and other exercises until I could get through the warm-up. Then I added the emphasis portion of the circuit for a week or so. Then I added the combination portion of the circuit. Now, being able to complete the full circuit one day a week, I increased to doing it two times a week (and that's where I'm at as of this writing).

1 percent improvements.

A marathon is completed 1 step at a time. You eat an elephant 1 bite at a time. And all the other analogies, metaphors, and cliches related to the idea that you need to start and persist until it's done to complete anything. 











Continuous improvement is a popular push in the Agile Software Development space. Continuous improvement also has a negative interpretation that results in things like hustle culture and feelings of never being good enough.

Many credit [Lean Manufacturing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing) with its inception, but I'm pretty sure it's just something inherent to the human condition and spirit, to be honest—time in motion studies resulting in the most efficient use of time and space to increase productivity. This leads us back to the days of Taylor and Ford.

Basically, it boils down to some questions:

1. How long can you stay active before becoming fatigued?
2. How long do you need to rest before you can perform at the same level as before?
3. How long are you prepared to go without seeing the desired result or improvement? And, how far is the desired result or improvement from where you are currently?

Every profession has had research performed regarding the first question. Decision fatigue in judges and doctors. Physical fatigue in manual labor professions. Emotional fatigue in coaches and therapists.

When there is improvement, it rarely happens in the midst of performing an activity. Something happens during the resting period, and the next time we perform the activity, all of that processing causes us to perform differently. Either at the same level or somewhat better.

This is the retrospective practice we see in many practices labeled as "Agile." It could be as often as after each meeting, each line of code, or weeks or months apart.

That third question is the one that bites many of us.









4. What areas of the environment or process can be changed to increase the time in the first question and decrease the time in the second question? (Process and environment optimization.) 

There are a lot of demons and anti-patterns in the answers to these questions. The main demon I see is in the typically unasked questions:

1. Is it okay to maintain where we are?
2. If not, how big (or small) of an improvement is acceptable?

My position is that 100 1 percent improvements are equal to 100 percent improvement.






Many of us default to it being about minimizing input while maximizing output, the productivity optimization position. Time motion studies and eeking out every possible point of optimization.

Unfortunately, improvement is only relevant when we consider the positives and negatives of any course of action.

I'm pretty sure this will be a hot take for some:

> Sometimes, reducing optimization is an improvement.
