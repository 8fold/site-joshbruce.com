# Shorthand

{!! dateblock !!}

Shorthand is helpful to communicate faster (benefit). To be effective, the use of shorthand requires participants to unpack the shorthand in the same way; otherwise, we are not "on the same page" (drawback)

When Custom Inkers (we) say "PL", we most likely mean "Personal Leave". However, if the receiver interprets "PL" as "Public Library", there is a disconnect.

> Communication is hard because language is soft.

In the previous sentence, "hard" means "difficult," and "soft" means "easy to mold." But, those aren't the only possible meanings of those words.

- Agile Software Development (or Agile) is shorthand for:
	- a set of [values](https://agilemanifesto.org) and [principles](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) outlined in The Manifesto for Agile Software Development.
- Scrum is shorthand for:
	- a set of values and practices aligned with Agile and outlined in [The Scrum Guide](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html) ([UKR](https://scrumguides.org/docs/scrumguide/v2020/2020-Scrum-Guide-Ukrainian.pdf) and [Czech](https://scrumguides.org/docs/scrumguide/v2020/2020-Scrum-Guide-Czech.pdf)). 
	- Where we get "Sprint," "Retrospective," and so on.
- eXtreme Programming (XP) is shorthand for:
	- a set of practices aligned with Agile and outlined in the "White book" (shorthand for [eXtreme Programming eXplained](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/extreme-programming-explained/0201616416/) by Kent Beck). 
	- Where we get "Pair Programming," "User Stories," "TDD" (shorthand for Test-Driven Development), and so on. ("Iteration" in XP is "Sprint" in Scrum.)
- Design Thinking is shorthand for:
	- a set of practices with an overview outlined by the [Interaction Design Foundation](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/design-thinking).
- DevOps is shorthand for:
	- a set of practices and tools, many of which are used in eXtreme Programming ([Wikipedia article, Agile section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps#Agile)).
- Jira/Monday/Trello/etc. are shorthand for:
	- a set of tools and features used to facilitate individuals and interactions.

Sometimes, shorthand is recursive. TDD, for example, is shorthand for a set of practices:

- Test-first development
- Refactoring

These values, principles, practices, and tools are not exclusive to the label used; see "iterations" in XPâ€”same practice, different shorthand.

You can "be Agile" (or any of the other labels) without knowing the terms or reading anything about them.
