# Estimation

{!! dateblock !!}

Becca shared [this post from Michael Lloyd](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7100551833881821184/) with me the other day.

Here's what it says:

> The 'estimation' fallacy can be simplified to a single problem;
>
> We need to identify work items that are too large (the outliers) but we mistakenly believe that we must also quantify the *degree* to which they are outliers, and so we start trying to guess at size, or effort or complexity.
>
> But none of that is necessary. As long as we identify the outliers, we can take action to break them into smaller pieces, without ever assigning values to them.
>
> This is why 'sizing' (the act of comparing small and big) can be useful, but 'estimation' (the act of applying values on some other dimension) is harmful.
>
> It's enough to see the elephant. You don't need to guess it's weight in order to effectively move out of the way.
