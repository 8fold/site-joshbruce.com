Put another way, the difference between knowledge and wisdom as expressed in the movie [*Peaceful Warrior*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0438315/) when Socrates asks Dan, “Do you know how to clean a windshield right?” To which Dan replies, “Yeah.” And Socrates, tossing a squeegee at Dan says, “Wisdom is doing it.”

This area of the site isn’t about education, information, or knowledge, it’s about how I’m taking the thoughts, research, and my own books and applying them to my day-to-day life.
