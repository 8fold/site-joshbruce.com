# Open source software

{!!dateblock!!}

I tend to create low-level specification- or standard-based open source products.

When I say low-level, I mean they’re designed to do one thing; hopefully well. When I say specification- or standard-based, I mean there’s typically a canonical source or reference one can use to design and settle disputes. If no specification or standard exists for the problem I’m trying to solve, I’ll either create one or find someone who has established a solid foundation.

Most of the products can be found on [8fold’s GitHub](https://github.com/8fold) page; including this site, its content, and change history.
