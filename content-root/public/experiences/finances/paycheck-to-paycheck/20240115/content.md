# January 15th, 2024 paycheck

This one felt a bit weird, to be honest.

I'm writing a [book](/books/#time-mastering-the-mundane) called *Time: Mastering the Mundane*. This isn't a shameless and pointless plug, I promise. The book is about self-management, primarily using things like reminders and to-do lists (what I call The Crucible and Forge). When it comes to paychecks, I have two reminders (see, it was relevant to the topic), but I'm thinking I should change it.

One reminder is to publish these articles. I publish one of these around the 15th and 28th of each month. This mirrors the cadence of someone getting paid twice a month, which is pretty standard in The United States but could vary. I've worked jobs where I was paid weekly and one where I was paid monthly. 

The other reminder is set on the schedule of when I get paid is me telling myself to pay my bills. My previous employer paid me every two weeks. The oddity, because time is a social construct and calendars even more so, is that being paid every two weeks means there are some months where I'd get paid twice before it was time to publish another article.

Right now, I don't have the cadence of an employer. There are a lot of possible terms to describe what I'm experiencing right now:

- Unemployment: Technically, this isn't true because I own my own business and I chose to leave my previous employer. The latter means I don't qualify for unemployment benefits.
- Mini-retirement: Technically, this isn't true either because it's supposed to be intentional and planned, and the coiners' have said so. It's a common use term; therefore, not in the dictionary.
- Sabbatical: Is kind of on the mark, but not really. Sabbatical is a break from your routine work, which has loads of wiggle room. As I define it, my routine work is helping people make peace with time and space (how's that for woo-woo?). I never stop this work. It's just who I am. 

So, in the spirit of making shit up, I've decided to call what I'm experiencing The Great Depickling, or just, The Depickling.

If you don't know how pickling works, you basically take something, put it into a brine solution, and leave it there for various lengths of time. Over time, whatever you put in there becomes "pickled." Many of us use the term "pickle" to refer to a "pickled cucumber." Technically, without the modifier, we don't know what type of pickle is because it could be just about anything. Pickled eggs, pickled okra, and so on. (It's also a preservative; pickled cucumbers can remain on a shelf longer than fresh.)

Anyway, back on topic.

While whatever you are pickling (we'll go with cucumber) is in the brine, a chemical reaction takes place, and the cucumber becomes "pickled."

I heard this recently as an analogy for employment. The ominous part of the story is the observation that the cucumber tends to take on the qualities of the brine more than the brine takes on the qualities of the cucumber.

The other coach I was talking with said they knew they needed to leave an employer when they were going to suggest something and thought, "That'll never work here."

That's what it is to become pickled by the client or employer.

The cadence of paychecks and its impact on the perception of time seems intriguing and something I'd like to keep. Further, I'd like to maintain the cadence we have for these articles. The question is: How?

Two weeks seems long enough that there's enough change in process, numbers, and my own thoughts to make the time to write about it. But that's not actually our cadence for these articles because tracking time is silly.

There are 26 2-week periods in a year. There are only 24 firsts and fifteenths in a year.

All right, I'm gonna stop thinking about the details and take some action.

I'm going to split up the "Pay bills" reminder:

1. credit cards and
2. rent.

Most of my underlying bills are automatic against a credit card. So, the "Pay bills" reminder is mainly a "Pay credit cards" reminder. Rent is the odd person out because it only comes out at the beginning of the month. That every two weeks, when the paycheck used to be received, I'd need to verify whether it was the "rent paycheck" or not—that's not as full of an explanation as I could have, but this is getting longwinded enough. So, by having 2 reminders, I don't need to take on the cognitive load of remembering to verify if this is a "rent paycheck" or not.

I'll set the "Pay credit cards" reminder to be weekly on Fridays. This will be a fixed reminder, which means even if I slip a coupla days, it should pop up again on Friday. I'll set the "Pay rent" reminder to be monthly on the last Friday.

I was already not being charged interest on credit card purchases because I'd pay the balance owed every two weeks instead of once a month, which does run the risk of interest accruing. Paying weekly reduces this risk even more. Having both of them set to be on Fridays means they will still both be together, but I can offload the brain power to the Apple Reminders app.

I also have a reminder to invoice my roommate, in this context, Becca, for some split bills I pay the full charge for. It's currently set to be sent on the 27th of each month because calendars are stupid, and not every month has a 29th, 30th, or 31st. I'm going to shift this to the last Friday of each month as well because she usually doesn't actually pay me back until she gets paid—on the first. This will be another fixed recurring action. So, no matter when I send her the "invoice" and no matter when she pays the invoice, it'll always be the last Friday of the month.

I have fixed recurring events related to reconciling accounts that go off when each institution releases new statements because humans haven't standardized on that, which kinda only makes sense because we haven't standardized on it. I'm sure there's a negative impact I'm not considering here, but still. These won't change.

I'm hoping these changes will help keep me from being pickled by an employer or client because mentally, the flow and the center of that flow will be less time- and employer-bound.

If you'd like to read about this hypothesis, please feel free; otherwise, I'm already impressed you stuck around this long.

## The flow

All revenue I receive goes into an "Income Account" (see Profit First). I use a spreadsheet to do some "napkin planning" on how the balance of the Income Account should be redistributed. I use Wave
