For this paycheck short-term assets were down the farthest compared to its target (not including the S&P 500 fund). I reduced my regular investment amount by about half. Put away for the future Roth [.Individual Retirement Account](IRA) contribution. Was able to reduce the amount going to the [.Health Savings Account](HSA) by a couple dollars due to contributions to date. Sent the standard percentage to the tax-prep account. And the suggested transfer to the runway.

It’s been a while since I talked about where each fund is compared to its target; the list above is an aggregate of the funds. Let’s talk fund allocations! (In a [later section](#fund-allocations) because it got longer than anticipated.)

## Fund allocations

The total market fund is above its target and below its high guardrail. The extended market fund is above its target and below its high guardrail. The multi-factor fund is below its target and above its low guardrail. The S&P 500 fund is below its target and above its minimum guardrail.

I’m still trying to keep the S&P 500 out of my taxable brokerage account because I’m still debating whether it’s part of the core strategy. If we think of the strategy from the inside-out, then it’s pretty much in the order of the previous paragraph: total stock market, extended market, multi-factor, and S&P 500. So, if I were to remove funds from the portfolio, I’d go in reverse order. And, each fund helps accomplish a specific goal and those goals may change.

The total stock market would be the bare minimum holding. It creates a broad base across every equity traded on The New York Stock Exchange. I have a goal of being relatively evenly distributed across small-, mid-, and large-cap companies, and that’s where the extended market fund comes in.

The extended market fund, in proportion to the total stock market fund gets me to the point of having a relatively even distribution across market capitalizations. The extended market fund is basically a total stock market fund without the large-cap companies. If I could only pick 2 funds, it’d be the total stock market and extended market funds. Another goal is to be roughly evenly distributed across value, blend, and growth; this is independent from the small-, mid-, and large-cap goal in that I do *not* have the goal of being 11 percent in each. The value, blend, and growth goal brings in the multi-factor fund.

The total stock market and extended market funds are both capitalization-weighted; higher the company’s valuation the more money, as a percent, goes to that company per contribution. Historically this means the funds end up being mostly blend with a tilt toward growth. The multi-factor fund I chose is essentially a total value fund and mainly mid-cap, with a slight tilt toward small-cap. If I only had 3 funds, chances are, it’d be the total stock market, the extended market, and the multi-factor fund. As I buy shares in the multi-factor fund, the portfolio starts tilting away from growth and toward value. With that said, these three funds can end up tilting the portfolio more toward small-cap. Tilting more toward small-cap isn’t necessarily bad, it’s just not a goal, which is 1 reason the S&P 500 fund comes into play.

The S&P 500 fund is there for 2 reasons. First, it’s the 1 I’ve found most often available in employer-sponsored retirement accounts, like a 401k; regardless of the other options. Second, it’s a large-cap blend fund. The first reason means it will most likely be part of the portfolio no matter what, the second reason opens the door to manage small- and mid-cap exposure more easily. If the portfolio starts sliding toward small-cap a bit too much, I can buy more shares in the S&P 500. If the portfolio seems a bit heavy in the mid-cap arena, I can buy more of the S&P 500.

All that being said, I want to avoid the S&P 500 fund being in the taxable brokerage account because it’s not part of the core *and* I want to keep things simple. Simplicity is one of [my core values](/experiences/the-self/#values) and is one of the [fundamental principles of investing](/essays-and-editorials/finances/concepts/#the-three-principles-of-investing).

Switching the 401k to be 50 percent S&P 500 and 50 percent extended market seems to be helping get the S&P 500 moving toward its target faster. It’s only been a couple of paychecks since making the shift and the extended market has dropped from 66 percent to 61. 

Contributing mainly to the multi-factor fund is also helping pull the extended market and total market funds down toward their respective targets.
