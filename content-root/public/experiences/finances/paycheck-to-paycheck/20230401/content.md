For this paycheck short-term assets were down the farthest compared to its target (not including the S&P 500 fund). I reduced my regular investment amount by about half. Put away for the future Roth [.Individual Retirement Account](IRA) contribution. Was able to reduce the amount going to the [.Health Savings Account](HSA) by a couple dollars due to contributions to date. Sent the standard percentage to the tax-prep account. And the suggested transfer to the runway.

 

## Health and wellness
