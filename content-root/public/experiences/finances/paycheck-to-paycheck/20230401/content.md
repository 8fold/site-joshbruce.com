{!! data !!}

For this paycheck short-term assets were down the farthest compared to its target (not including the S&P 500 fund). I reduced my regular investment amount by about half. Put away for the future Roth [.Individual Retirement Account](IRA) contribution. Was able to reduce the amount going to the [.Health Savings Account](HSA) by a couple dollars due to contributions to date. Sent the standard percentage to the tax-prep account. And the suggested transfer to the runway.

It’s been a while since I talked about where each fund is; the list above is an aggregate (and estimated percentages) of the funds. Let’s do it! (In a [later section](#fund-allocations) because it got longer than anticipated.)

## Fund Allocations

The total market fund is above its target and below its high guardrail. The extended market fund is above its target and below its high guardrail. The multi-factor fund is below its target and above its low guardrail. The S&P 500 fund is below its target and above its minimum guardrail.

I’m still trying to keep the S&P 500 out my taxable brokerage account because I’m still debating whether it’s part of the core strategy. If we think of the strategy from the inside-out, then it’s pretty much in the order of the previous paragraph: total stock market, extended market, multi-factor, and S&P 500. So, if I were to remove funds from the portfolio, I’d go in reverse order. And, each fund helps accomplish a specific goal and those goals may change.

The total stock market would be the bare minimum holding. It creates a broad base across every equity traded on The New York Stock Exchange. Right now, I have a goal being relatively evenly distributed across small-, mid-, and large-cap companies, and that’s where the extended market fund comes into play.

The extended market fund, in proportion to the total stock market fund gets me to the point of having a relatively even distribution across market capitalizations. It achieves this by effectively removing the large-cap stocks. If I could only pick 2, it’d be the total stock market and extended market funds. My other goal is to be roughly evenly distributed across value blend and growth; this is independent from the small-, mid-, and large-cap goal in that I do *not* have the goal of being 11 percent in each. The value, blend, and growth brings in the multi-factor fund.

The total stock market and extended market funds are both capitalization-weighted; greater the valuation of the company the more money, as a percent, goes to that company. In general this means the funds end up being mostly blend with a slight tilt toward growth. The multi-factor fund I chose is essentially a total value fund. It’s mainly mid-cap, with a slight tilt toward small-cap. If I only had 3 funds, chances are, it’d be the total stock market, the extended market, and the multi-factor funds. As I buy shares in the multi-factor fund, the portfolio starts tilting away from growth and toward value. With that said, these three funds can end up tilting the portfolio more toward small-cap. Tilting more toward small-cap isn’t necessarily bad, it’s just not a goal, which is 1 reason the S&P 500 fund comes into play.

The S&P 500 fund is there for 2 reasons. First, it’s the 1 I’ve found most often available in employer-sponsored retirement accounts, like a 401k; regardless of the other options. Second, it’s a large-cap blend fund. The first reason means it will most likely be part of the portfolio no matter what, the second reason opens the door to manage small- and mid-cap exposure more easily. If the portfolio starts sliding toward small-cap a bit too much, I can buy more shares in the S&P 500.

All that being said, I want to avoid the S&P 500 fund being in the taxable brokerage account because it’s not part of the core *and* I want to keep things simple. Simplicity is one of [my core values](/experiences/the-self/#values) and is one of the [fundamental principles of investing](/essays-and-editorials/finances/concepts/#the-three-principles-of-investing).

Switching the 401k to be 50 percent S&P 500 and 50 percent extended market seems to helping get the S&P 500 moving toward its target faster. It’s only been a couple of paychecks since making the shift and the extended market has dropped from 66 percent to 61. 

Contributing mainly to the multi-factor fund is also helping pull the extended market and total market funds down toward their respective targets.
