# April 1st, 2023 paycheck

{!! dateblock !!}

{!! data !!}

For this paycheck, short-term assets were down the farthest compared to its target (not including the S&P 500 fund). I reduced my regular investment amount by about half. Put away for the future Roth [.Individual Retirement Account](IRA) contribution. Was able to reduce the amount going to the [.Health Savings Account](HSA) by a couple of dollars due to contributions to date. Sent the standard percentage to the tax-prep account. And the suggested transfer to the runway.

It’s been a while since I discussed where each fund is compared to its target; the list above is an aggregate of the funds. Let’s talk fund allocations! (In a [later section](#fund-allocations) because it got longer than anticipated.)

## Fund allocations

The total market fund is above its target and below its high guardrail. The extended market fund is above its target and below its high guardrail. The multi-factor fund is below its target and above its low guardrail. The S&P 500 fund is below its target and above its minimum guardrail.

I’m still trying to keep the S&P 500 out of my taxable brokerage account because I’m still debating whether it’s part of the core strategy. If we think of the strategy from the inside-out, then it’s pretty much in the order of the previous paragraph: total stock market, extended market, multi-factor, and S&P 500. So, if I were to remove funds from the portfolio, I’d go in reverse order. And each fund helps accomplish a specific goal, and those goals may change.

The total stock market would be the bare minimum holding. It creates a broad base across every New York Stock Exchange equity traded. I aim to be relatively evenly distributed across small-, mid-, and large-cap companies, where the extended market fund comes in.

In proportion to the total stock market fund, the extended market fund gives me a relatively even distribution across market capitalizations. The extended market fund is a total stock market fund without large-cap companies. If I could only pick 2 funds, they’d be the total stock market and extended market funds. Another goal is to be roughly evenly distributed across value, blend, and growth; this is independent of the small-, mid-, and large-cap goals in that I do *not* have the goal of being 11 percent in each of the 9 combinations. The value, blend, and growth goal bring in the multi-factor fund.

The total stock market and extended market funds are capitalization-weighted; the higher the company’s valuation, the more money, as a percentage, goes to that company per contribution. Historically this means the funds are mostly blended with a tilt toward growth. The multi-factor fund I chose is basically a total value fund, mainly mid-cap, with a slight tilt toward small-cap. If I only had 3 funds, it’d be the total stock market, the extended market, and the multi-factor fund. As I buy shares in the multi-factor fund, the portfolio starts tilting away from growth and toward value. With that said, these three funds can end up tilting the portfolio toward small-cap. Tilting more toward small-cap isn’t necessarily bad; it’s just not a goal, which is 1 reason the S&P 500 fund comes into play.

The S&P 500 fund is there for 2 reasons. First, it’s the 1 I’ve found most often available in employer-sponsored retirement accounts, like a 401k, regardless of the other options. Second, it’s a large-cap blend fund. The first reason means it will most likely be part of the portfolio no matter what, and the second reason opens the door to managing small- and mid-cap exposure more easily. If the portfolio starts sliding toward small-cap a bit too much, I can buy more shares in the S&P 500. If the portfolio seems heavy in the mid-cap arena, I can buy more of the S&P 500.

I want to avoid the S&P 500 fund being in the taxable brokerage account because it’s not part of the core and would be the first to go. Further, I want to keep things simple. Simplicity is one of [my core values](/experiences/the-self/#values) and is one of the [fundamental principles of investing](/essays-and-editorials/finances/concepts/#the-three-principles-of-investing).

Switching the 401k to be 50 percent S&P 500 and 50 percent extended market seems to be helping get the S&P 500 moving toward its target faster. It’s only been a couple of paychecks since making the shift, and the extended market has dropped from 66 percent to 61 percent in the 401k. 

Contributing mainly to the multi-factor fund is also helping pull the extended market and total market funds down toward their respective targets.

This got me thinking and is [continued below](#asset-allocations-and-fund-allocations-continued).

## Health and wellness

Annual bloodwork came back clear, except the uric acid levels shot up to almost 7. I'm back to taking allopurinol. Frustrating.

I started doing some daily exercise movements again, except for the plank and the regular pushups.

## Asset allocations and fund allocations continued

Refining [The Universal Portfolio](/essays-and-editorials/finances/the-universal-portfolio/) concept made me dig deeper into The Holy Grail of Investing concept. Reflecting on the exploration results and learning how to use the tools better has me wanting to change the progression of portfolios.

My goals as of this writing, primarily when it comes to equities:

1. Roughly an even distribution across small-, mid-, and large-cap equities (growth).
2. Roughly an even distribution across value, blend, and growth (growth).
3. Maintain 6 percent cash (short-term assets).

I revisited Portfolio Charts and [The Golden Butterfly](https://portfoliocharts.com/portfolio/golden-butterfly/) portfolio. The [withdrawal rates chart for The Golden Butterfly](https://portfoliocharts.com/portfolio/withdrawal-rates/) shows a safe withdrawal rate and perpetual withdrawal rate of about 8 percent for a 30-year retirement. The [withdrawal rates chart for the original Mark 1](https://portfoliocharts.com/portfolio/withdrawal-rates/?shortcode=ZUSAXAB09AC05AD10AH12AI11AJ05AK25AM06GA06GB11Z) shows a safe withdrawal rate and perpetual withdrawal rate of about 5 percent for a 30-year retirement. 

The rate of return isn't one of the primary goals. However, I remembered that The Golden Butterfly portfolio did wind up with a roughly even distribution across market capitalizations, which *is* one of the goals. I got curious.

I pulled [Morningstar](https://www.morningstar.com) data for the [Vanguard Small-cap Value [.Exchange-Traded Fund](ETF)](https://www.morningstar.com/etfs/arcx/vbr/portfolio) and used the spreadsheet to create the fund allocation for The Golden Butterfly. Here are the results for the style boxes:

1. 34 percent value,
2. 45.5 percent blend, 
3. 20.5 percent growth,
4. 36 percent large,
5. 29.5 percent mid, and
6. 34.5 percent small.

The Golden Butterfly could almost achieve the goals by itself, the odd one being that growth would be 20 percent, not closer to 30. 

I ran a [Portfolio Visualizer comparison](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=1985&firstMonth=1&endYear=2023&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&leverageType=0&leverageRatio=0.0&debtAmount=0&debtInterest=0.0&maintenanceMargin=25.0&leveragedBenchmark=false&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=false&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&benchmarkSymbol=VTI&portfolioNames=true&portfolioName1=The+Golden+Butterfly+-+modified&portfolioName2=Mark+0&portfolioName3=Total+stock+market&symbol1=VTI&allocation1_1=47&allocation1_2=13&allocation1_3=94&symbol2=VBR&allocation2_1=47&allocation2_2=0&symbol3=VOO&allocation3_2=11&symbol4=VXF&allocation4_2=45&symbol5=VFMF&allocation5_2=25&symbol6=GLDM&allocation6_1=0&allocation6_2=0&allocation6_3=0&symbol7=VGSH&allocation7_1=6&allocation7_2=0&allocation7_3=6&symbol8=VGLT&allocation8_1=0&allocation8_2=0&allocation8_3=0&symbol9=CASHX&allocation9_2=6) between the Golden Butterfly equity portion with 6 percent cash and the Mark 0 as is. As expected, they performed almost equally, at least with the 4 years of data available given the multi-factor fund. 

I started looking at the growth assets in the Mark 0 portfolio and was curious if I could get to a similar mix with 3 core funds instead of 4; simplification. I also noticed I had too many progressions due to an off-by-1 error (starting at 0 instead of 1), so, to reduce confusing myself any further, I renamed the Mark portfolios to match the Coast FI stack:

1. Mark 0 became Mark 1.
2. Mark 0.2 became Mark 2.
3. Mark 0.4 became Mark 3.
4. Mark 0.6 was removed.
5. Mark 0.8 became Mark 4.
6. Mark 1 became Mark 5.

Now I can follow standard [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) (too much time as a developer).

I started plugging numbers into the spreadsheet. According to the spreadsheet, I ended up here to achieve a similar mix of styles as The Golden Butterfly.

1. 13 percent total stock market fund.
2. 53 percent small-cap value fund.
3. 32 percent S&P 500 fund.
4. 1 percent extended market fund.
5. 1 percent multi-factor fund.

To validate the spreadsheet, I ran another [Portfolio Visualizer comparison](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=1985&firstMonth=1&endYear=2023&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&leverageType=0&leverageRatio=0.0&debtAmount=0&debtInterest=0.0&maintenanceMargin=25.0&leveragedBenchmark=false&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=false&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&benchmark=-1&benchmarkSymbol=VTI&portfolioNames=true&portfolioName1=The+Golden+Butterfly+-+Mark+1+cash&portfolioName2=Mark+1.1&portfolioName3=Mark+1&symbol1=VTI&allocation1_1=47&allocation1_2=12.22&allocation1_3=13&symbol2=VBR&allocation2_1=47&allocation2_2=49.82&symbol3=VOO&allocation3_2=30.08&allocation3_3=11&symbol4=VXF&allocation4_2=0.94&allocation4_3=45&symbol5=VFMF&allocation5_2=0.94&allocation5_3=25&symbol6=CASHX&allocation6_1=6&allocation6_2=6&allocation6_3=6) between:
1. the Golden Butterfly equity fund allocation with cash,
2. the proposed equity fund allocation with cash for Mark 1.1, and
3. Mark 1. 

The performance was roughly the same, as expected, given it was mostly equities. However, Mark 1 did perform a little better during the 2021 runup before normalizing in 2022. The exposures were also roughly the same, as expected, given the numbers in the spreadsheet were very close as well. I set a benchmark using a total stock market fund and found it performed better than all three during the 2021 runup before normalizing in 2022.

I ran [another comparison](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=1985&firstMonth=1&endYear=2023&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&leverageType=0&leverageRatio=0.0&debtAmount=0&debtInterest=0.0&maintenanceMargin=25.0&leveragedBenchmark=false&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=false&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&benchmark=-1&benchmarkSymbol=VTI&portfolioNames=true&portfolioName1=The+Golden+Butterfly+-+Mark+5+cash&portfolioName2=Mark+5&symbol1=VTI&allocation1_1=20&allocation1_2=6&symbol2=VBR&allocation2_1=20&allocation2_2=21&symbol3=VOO&allocation3_2=13&symbol4=VXF&symbol5=VFMF&symbol6=CASHX&allocation6_1=6&allocation6_2=6&symbol7=VGSH&allocation7_1=14&allocation7_2=14&symbol8=VGLT&allocation8_1=20&allocation8_2=20&symbol9=GLDM&allocation9_1=20&allocation9_2=20), this time with:

1. the full Golden Butterfly and 
2. a proposed Mark 5. 

I swapped 6 percent cash for The Golden Butterfly and reduced short-term treasuries to 14 percent. As expected, both portfolios performed roughly the same.

The conclusion was that I could:

1. achieve the primary goals, 
2. possibly increase the withdrawal rate, 
3. reduce the number of funds, 
4. reduce the allocation to growth assets to 40 percent instead of 50, 
5. increase the allocation to short-term assets, and 
6. reduce expenses.

Further, this established The Golden Butterfly as the benchmark for the Mark series of portfolios, with a deep fallback of the total stock market.

The original set of Mark portfolios, using the new numbering scheme:

- Mark 1: Coast FI 1
	- Liabilities: 0 to 1 percent; target of 0.
	- Short-term assets: 3 to 9 percent; target of 6.
	- Growth assets: 91 to 97 percent; target of 94.
	- Negative correlation assets: 0 to 1 percent; target of 0.
	- Low correlation assets; target of 0.
- Mark 2: Coast FI 2
	- Liabilities: same.
	- Short-term assets: same.
	- Growth assets: 74 to 97 percent; target of 92.
	- Negative correlation assets: 0 to 2 percent; target of 2.
	- Low correlation assets: same.
- Mark 3: Coast FI 3
	- Liabilities: same.
	- Short-term assets: same.
	- Growth assets: 67 to 97 percent; target of 84.
	- Negative correlation assets: 6 to 10 percent; target of 8.
	- Low correlation assets: 0 to 2 percent; target of 2.
- Mark 4: Coast FI 4
	- Liabilities: same.
	- Short-term assets: same.
	- Growth assets: 48 to 72 percent; target of 60.
	- Negative correlation assets: 17 to 25 percent; target of 21.
	- Low correlation: 10 to 16 percent; target of 13.
- Mark 5: Coast FI 5 and beyond
	- Liabilities: same.
	- Short-term assets: same.
	- Growth assets: 40 to 60 percent; target of 50.
	- Negative correlation assets: 20 to 30 percent; target of 25.
	- Low correlation assets: 15 to 23 percent; target of 19.

Luckily, because we're using The Universal Portfolio model, things don't change that much, despite many things changing under the hood.

- Mark 1.1: Coast FI 1
	- No change at the top-level, underlying fund allocation, and funds change.
- Mark 2: Coast FI 2
- Mark 3: Coast FI 3
	- Liabilities: same.
	- Short-term assets: same.
	- Growth assets: 67 to 97 percent; target of 84.
	- *Negative correlation assets: 8 to 12 percent; target of 10.*
	- *Low correlation assets: 0 to 2 percent; target of 0.*
- Mark 4: Coast FI 4
	- Liabilities: same.
	- *Short-term assets: 8 to 12 percent; target 10.*
	- Growth assets: 56 to 84 percent; target of 70.
	- Negative correlation assets: same.
	- *Low correlation: 8 to 12 percent; target of 10.*
- Mark 5: Coast FI 5 and beyond
	- Liabilities: same.
	- *Short-term assets: 16 to 24; target of 20.*
	- *Growth assets: 32 to 48 percent; target of 40.*
	- *Negative correlation assets: 16 to 24 percent; target of 20.*
	- *Low correlation assets: 16 to 24 percent; target of 20.*

Let's look at the proposed fund allocations that make up the Mark 1 portfolio:

1. 13 percent total stock market fund.
2. 53 percent small-cap value fund.
3. 32 percent S&P 500 fund.
4. 1 percent extended market fund.
5. 1 percent multi-factor fund.

These would probably be the same equity fund targets until Mark 4 or 5; if things remain the same. Mark 4 or 5 would be something like:

1. 14 percent total stock market fund.
2. 54 percent small-cap value fund.
3. 32 percent S&P 500 fund.

Most likely from selling the extended market and multi-factor fund to purchase other assets. I hope the S&P 500 fund will only be in the tax-deferred accounts. As I spend down the tax-deferred accounts, the internal fund allocations would begin shifting to:

1. 50 percent total stock market fund.
2. 50 percent small-cap value fund.

Except for the decision to have 6 percent allocated to cash, I'd be fully in The Golden Butterfly portfolio. Of course, that'd be almost 27 years from now, so who knows, really?
