# January 1st, 2022 paycheck

{!! data !!}

This is a double paycheck. The first came in on December 16 and the second on December 30.

On the first check, the target for investing was the multi-factor fund. It was down the previous day so, went with the 2 cent over, 1 percent down, and 2 percent down limit orders. All three orders executed. 

## Allocations

When 2022 started I was overweight large-cap equities. I started rebalancing my 401k at my former employer and, at the fund level, I became overweight in the extended market fund. I became overweight because the extended market fund is in all the accounts for two reasons:

1. I was trying to keep up with the large-cap allocation in my 401k to hit the target allocation; didn't work.
2. The extended market holds the longest time horizon, so to speak.

Initially I started with the extended market fund only being my [.Health Savings Account](HSA) and Roth [.Individual Retirement Account](IRA) because I don't plan on withdrawing from those until around age 70. Then the extended market fund was added to the taxable brokerage account because I wasn't able to keep up with my 401k going to the S&P 500 only. I also had a rollover from a 401k at another employer that went into my Traditional IRA, in an extended market fund.

No matter what I did though, I couldn't keep up with how much was going into the S&P 500. So, I did a series of reallocations in my 401k to a total small- and total mid-cap fund; just 33-33-33 percent to each and in each. 

Once that was complete, I was overweight in the extended market fund and pretty heavy in small-cap equities in general. Then I switched employers midway through 2022.

I did a rollover of the 401k from my former employer into my Traditional IRA and that went well; see previous paychecks. This resulted in an allocation closer to the targets, however, the total market fund was a bit on the high side.

My new employer offers an extended market fund in their 401k offerings. I set the allocation to be 66 percent toward the extended market fund and 34 percent toward the S&P 500 fund. Last I checked with [Portfolio Visualizer](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio) this gives a roughly even distribution across small-, mid-, and large-cap equities; tilted more toward small. I've been considering switching the allocation per paycheck to be a 50-50 split instead.


Last I checked, this allocation gives me the almost even distribution between small-, mid-, and large-cap equities I'm looking for. I've been considering changing the allocation in my 401k to be more of a fifty-fifty split because, at the fund level, the extended market is still pretty high.

## Dining out adjustments

Coming into 2022 I set a goal for myself, which was to spend more money on regular food than on dining out. I did not make it.

I managed to spend about 20 percent less on dining out in 2022 than I did in 2021 though. Further, the distance between the two was not a dramatic.

Going into 2023 I'm going to set the same goal and see how it goes.

I'll try and use my previous strategy of eating out once a month, usually around the first (or the paycheck for the first) of the month.

Of course, the less I eat out, the more I will naturally spend on groceries.

## Health and wellness

Quick recap: A few months ago I had a sever pain in the big toe of my right foot; then again a month later. While I did not experience all the [symptoms of gout](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gout/symptoms-causes/syc-20372897), that's what we diagnosed and treated it as. We checked my uric acid levels, and they did indicate slight hyperuricemia ([high uric acid levels](https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/high-uric-acid-level/basics/definition/sym-20050607)). Found a research paper on [purine levels in 80 food products](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32312146/). I created a spreadsheet to detail the calories, macronutrient, and micronutrient content of the food I eat regularly; including purine content when I could find actual numbers. My normal breakfast, the breakfast sausage in particular, seemed to be the main culprit; I couldn't find specific numbers for the sausage itself and used the more general "pork" levels from the paper. Switched out the sausage for a blend of pumpkin seeds (pipitas) and cashews. This switch maintained my caloric intake and macronutrient levels while increasing micronutrients (including electrolytes).

While exploring this problem I went to a pediatrist and sports physician. 

The podiatrist agreed on the diagnosis of hyperuricemia (condition) and gout (attack). We removed an ingrown toenail on my right big toe. I learned how to give myself pedicures, which seemed to help in general; it was one of those things where I didn't know I was uncomfortable until I became more comfortable. Had some toenail fungus with some dehydration of the toenails and started using a nail mycosis solution on a regular basis. I managed to remove the impacted portion of the big toenail on my left foot.

The sports physician pointed out some weaknesses in the kinetic chain of my right leg and recommended some exercises to strengthen that whole thing; specifically hip raises. He also recognized my upper thoracic spine was a bit locked and we cracked that, which helped. 

I've been off the anti-inflammatories (mainly [colchicine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK431102/)) for about a month. The week as I'm writing this I also haven't been taking the medication to reduce the uric acid in my blood ([allopurinol](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK499942/)).

The second toenail on my right foot had the worst of the fungus. The regular use of the nail mycosis and "thinning" of the toenail using a light buffer block on the top of the toenail has caused some of he "dead" layers (lack of a better term) of the toenail to fall off completely. I'm also noticing the new growth of both my big toe and second is noticeably less thick than the nail that was there. So, my guess is there was definitely some stuff between the layers of the nails.
