Market was up the previous day, so I did the market, 2 cents over, and 1 percent down limit orders to buy the multi-factor fund. 2 of the 3 executed. The market closed up again that day and there was enough in the settlement account to try and buy some more.

That’ll be for next paycheck though.

I increased the contribution to my 401k to hit the annual contribution limit. 

I decreased the contribution to my [.Health Savings Account](HSA) despite the contribution limit increasing. My employer does a contribution of 500 [.United States Dollars](USD). Unfortunately, it has to go to their custodian and there has to be 1,000 USD balance before contributions can go toward investments. So, I won’t see the investing benefit there until I’ve been with the company a couple years.

I need to verify the account is setup as there were some problems when I was first hired.

## Allocations

All the funds are within their minimum and maximum thresholds. In fact, all but the S&P 500 fund are within their low and high thresholds. Good times. 

The extended market does appear to be creeping up to its higher limit. We’ll see what happens next paycheck. I’m debating on shifting to either sixty-forty or fifty-fifty for the extended market and S&P 500 in the 401k.

## Skill improvement

I’m appreciating Grammarly so far and can see myself purchasing a one year plan after this month is over.

## Health and wellness

I haven’t taken the colchicine for over a month now. Haven’t had the allopurino for a week or so.

Seem to be doing okay.
