Pretty uneventful on the money front. Did the regular, automatic distributions to the various accounts:

1. savings,
2. [.Health Savings Account](HSA),
3. 401k,
4. tax,
5. et cetera.

Had enough left to make 3 limit orders to the taxable account. One executed. Didn’t have enough after that to make more trades.

Part of me was disappointed that I couldn’t make more trades. Another part of me was pretty pleased because not being able to do more trades contributed to me hitting the target 6 percent cash and staying there.

More kudos to the current method.

## Health and wellness

Meanwhile, on the health front I’m getting pretty pissed off at my body and the medical profession.

I decided to do a few inverted rows every day for a week. By the end of the week I was so messed up I went to the clinic and they put me on steroids and muscle relaxers.

I don’t think I can explain it well.

In general, my muscles are like gelatin. Wobbly, chill, and pliable. By the time my back was its worse:

- my upper left upper trapezius was a rock to the point my left shoulder was being pulled higher than the right. 
- my right upper trapezius wasn’t doing much better.
- it felt like someone was pushing a sharp object into the junction between my cervical and thoracic spine.
- I could feel portions of my thoracic spine in ways that one should not be able to feel their thoracic spine.

So, I’ve modified my language and goals again:

> I’d like to be able to do one regular pushup, one inverted row, and one air squat every day without pain or being relatively immobilized for a week afterward.

In communication with my doctor I also said:

> All of this is new for me, given my history is no pain or drastic illness for 20 or 30 years straight; very disconcerting, and I’m not sure if I should push or pause.
>
> Am I just de-conditioned? Or is there a medical issue, and pushing will make it worse? Or is 40 really that bad, and I should reconsider my future despite hereditary evidence?

I’ve started considering psoriasis with possible psoriatic arthritis. The symptoms for psoriasis seem to cover more ground than gout alone. Not to say it can’t be both.

I don’t get sick. Physically I’ve never been particularly hard or soft on myself. And I’ve seen more doctors in the past 2 years than I have in my entire life.
