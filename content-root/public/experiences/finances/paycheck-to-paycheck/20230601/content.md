The small-cap value fund was up the previous day. I placed a market order and two limit orders. All 3 executed.

I committed a blunder.

Apparently, when I placed the market order, I neglected to enter the decimal point. So, instead of it being for around 180.00 [.United States Dollars], it was for 18,000 USD.

I don’t have 18,000 dollars.

I didn’t catch it early enough and incurred the [freeriding penalty](https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/online-trading/trading-violations-penalties). Good times.

Something like this happened when I rolled over my Roth Individual Retirement Account as well.

I was freaking out, well, freaking out for me. Meanwhile the Vanguard representative was quite calm and acting like it wasn’t a big deal.

Im still debating on whether I’m going to call Vanguard to place trades from now on.

I guess we’ll see.

You may notice the debt component is creeping up. That’s mainly due to a MovNat bundle purchase and a 2 hour massage. You can read more about all that in [health and wellness](/experiences/health-and-wellness/) area.
