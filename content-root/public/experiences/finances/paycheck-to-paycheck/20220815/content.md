# August 15th, 2022 paycheck

{!! data !!}

My new employer has an extended market fund. After two calls we were able to find the public equivalent and, come to find out, it tracks very closely to the extended market fund I already have. I changed the allocation to be 66-34 percent in the extended market and S&P 500.

The portfolio was just a bit out of balance over the intervening weeks before this paycheck; less than 1 percent over in cash. Contributions and buying the dip fixed that. Contributions went to the multi-factor fund and buying the dip went toward the extended market fund the first Thursday between paychecks and the total stock market the second week. The percent-based approach to [buying a dip](/experiences/finances/personal-budget/#spending-savings) seems to be proving itself viable.

I was able to call the 401k provider and get the public equivalent for their extended market fund and decided to do a 66 percent extended market and 34 percent S&P 500 split. So, moving forward the portfolio should remain relatively in balance; however, it will remain tilted toward the large-cap growth side of things, I think. 

Updated the spreadsheet based on these new details:

1. I added a chart for the total portfolio using individual vehicles. The chart I use for these posts show the macro-allocations. This new chart shows me which individual funds are down or up compared to their targets and ranges. When I created the chart, the portfolio was in balance, however, it was high in the extended market and low in the multi-factor and total stock market funds.
2. I use [Apple Numbers](https://www.apple.com/numbers/) with multiple tables in one sheet. I changed the arrangement of calculated tables I don't need to do data entry on. I did the same thing with the tables where I do perform data entry.
3. I reduced the target allocation for the small- and mid- funds in my old 401k by 1 percent as I won’t be putting more toward those in the future. I increased the target percent for the extended market and S&P 500 funds by 1 percent each. This should account for the new 401k while I’m still holding the old.

## Rolling over the 401k

## Other projects

## FI experiments

Details are in the [January 15th, 2022 paycheck](/finances/paycheck-to-paycheck/20220115/#fi-experiments).

The hypothesis is when the Mark 0.0 mix is down, it‘ll be down more than the others. Further, when the Mark 0.0 is up, the others will be up and not too far behind the Mark 0.0. We will track the change since the previous paycheck as well as the change since we started tracking January 2022.
