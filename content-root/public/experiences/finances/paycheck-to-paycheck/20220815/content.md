# August 15th, 2022 paycheck

{!! dateblock !!}

{!! data !!}

My new employer has an extended market fund. After two calls we were able to find the public equivalent and, come to find out, it tracks very closely to the extended market fund I already have. I changed the allocation to be 66-34 percent in the extended market and S&P 500.

The portfolio was just a bit out of balance over the intervening weeks before this paycheck; less than 1 percent over in cash. Contributions and buying the dip fixed that.

Updated the spreadsheet based on these new details.

## Rolling over the 401k

## Other projects

## FI experiments

Details are in the [January 15th, 2022 paycheck](/finances/paycheck-to-paycheck/20220115/#fi-experiments).

The hypothesis is when the Mark 0.0 mix is down, itâ€˜ll be down more than the others. Further, when the Mark 0.0 is up, the others will be up and not too far behind the Mark 0.0. We will track the change since the previous paycheck as well as the change since we started tracking January 2022.
