This is an odd paycheck because I actually got paid on the second of December.

The next paycheck will be two though.

The first set of orders was the two cents over, 1 percent down, and 2 percent down for the multi-factor fund; only 1 executed. The second set of orders was the market, two cents over, and 1 percent down.

## Closing M1 Finance

Iâ€™m still trying to reach a tighter balance at the fund level before actively contributing here.

## Update on the dip

 No extra cash going toward the dip.
