It’s hard to believe this series is almost two years old. I’m pretty sure this is a record for me with consistently posting content. Historically I go in fits and starts.

Basically I’d post everyday for about a month and then disappear for a few months.

With that said, happy new year.

That is, if this represents a new year to you in the calendar you follow.

It’s fascinating how much significance human societies have placed on dates and times. We wait for the end of the year to change our lives and ourselves; new year, new me. Or maybe a birthday. Or a holiday. Or some other arbitrary day we recognize as an anniversary of something.

It’s arbitrary.

Man-made.

One of my mantras is: Every day is a holiday.

Of course, we operate in a world that doesn’t work that way and it really sucks when you go to your favorite restaurant only to discover they’re closed because calendars.

Anyway!

This was the last two paychecks of the year.

For the first, markets were down on the first trading day. Went with the 2-1-2 approach.
