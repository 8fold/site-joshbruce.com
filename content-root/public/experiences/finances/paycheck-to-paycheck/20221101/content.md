## 401k rollover

The rollover was completed in the previous paycheck. 

## Closing M1 Finance

Starting to think this wonâ€™t happen in 2022.

## Update on the dip

## Changes to diet and spending

Did another full self pedicure. Removed a fair amount of the big toenail on my right foot. It was kinda strange. I removed more of the dead skin under the nail and trimmed to the actual attachment point. 

My foot feels much better. 

Diet change is going extremely well.
