# November 1st, 2022 paycheck

Given I now have the extended market and S&P 500 in my 401k I’m hoping the taxable account will be limited to just the total market and multi-factor funds. My initial intent was to only have the total market fund in the taxable account. Unfortunately, I couldn’t contribute enough to small- and mid-caps via the Roth [.Individual Retirement Account](IRA) and [.Health Savings Account](HSA) to put the portfolio into balance.

Right now the total market fund is at its high end, the extended market is edging its way there, and the S&P 500 fund is just above its minimum threshold. So, for now, still contributing to the multi-factor fund.

I changed the settings for what to do with capital gains and dividends in the Traditional IRA. Instead of reinvesting automatically, they’ll go into the settlement fund, which affords me the opportunity to choose how to reinvest them. 

## 401k rollover

The rollover was completed in the previous paycheck. 

## Closing M1 Finance

Starting to think this won’t happen in 2022.

## Update on the dip

## Changes to diet and spending

Did another full self pedicure. Removed a fair amount of the big toenail on my right foot. It was kinda strange. I removed more of the dead skin under the nail and trimmed to the actual attachment point. 

My foot feels much better. 

Diet change is going extremely well.
