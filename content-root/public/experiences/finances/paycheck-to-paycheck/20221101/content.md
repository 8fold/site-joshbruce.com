# November 1st, 2022 paycheck

{!! data !!}

Given I now have the extended market and S&P 500 in my 401k I’m hoping the taxable account will be limited to just the total market and multi-factor funds. My initial intent was to only have the total market fund in the taxable account. Unfortunately, I couldn’t contribute enough to small- and mid-caps via the Roth [.Individual Retirement Account](IRA) and [.Health Savings Account](HSA) to put the portfolio into balance.

Right now the total market fund is at its high end, the extended market is edging its way there, and the S&P 500 fund is just above its minimum threshold. So, for now, still contributing to the multi-factor fund.

I changed the settings for what to do with capital gains and dividends in the Traditional IRA. Instead of reinvesting automatically, they’ll go into the settlement fund, which affords me the opportunity to choose how to reinvest them. 

I realized a flaw in my spreadsheet; [more on that below](#spreadsheet-update). I changed how often I plan to update the Morningstar data for each fund in my portfolio; going from annually to quarterly. I just did this in July and wasn't expecting enough of a change to matter, but there was. This should give me a chance to get a feel for how much these things tend to change.

When I did my regular contribution toward the multi-factor fund using the 15, 35, 50 limit order setup, the funds (and the market) rallied a bit and none of the orders executed. So, the next chance I get I will use the 40 and 60 setup to place more limit orders.

## 401k rollover

The rollover was completed in the previous paycheck. 

It's interesting. Now that I have the extended market fund inside my 401k, I believe the taxable brokerage account will mainly be for the total market and multi-factor funds. When I initially started the taxable brokerage account, I didn't want the extended market to be in there because of the volatility.

If you don't know, the taxable brokerage account is there for me to use between the 50 year old or so mark until about 60, when I'll start drawing down on the tax-deferred accounts (401k and Traditional IRA).

With that said, having the extended market fund there will kick off dividends and give me added flexibility, so, no plans to remove it from the taxable brokerage account; especially not while we're going through this downturn. 

## Closing M1 Finance

Starting to think this won’t happen in 2022.

## Update on the dip

Didn't put anything toward the dip this time.

## Changes to diet and spending

Did another full self pedicure. Removed a fair amount of the big toenail on my right foot. It was kinda strange. I removed more of the dead skin under the nail and trimmed to the attachment point. 

My foot feels much better. 

Diet change is going well.

## Spreadsheet update

I recently updated the [Morningstar data](https://www.morningstar.com) for the funds I use. Some of them are shifting away from growth, toward blend and value; the joys of market-cap weighting. What I realized after updating those numbers was that the graph I use adjusted in an undesirable way; specifically, for the 9 factors (or styles) of:

1. small-cap value,
2. small-cap blend,
3. small-cap growth,
4. mid-cap value,
5. mid-cap blend,
6. mid-cap growth,
7. large-cap value,
8. large-cap blend, and
9. large-cap growth.

Basically, the targets ended up adjusting based on the current Morningstar numbers, which is not what I want to do. I want to be able to establish targets that don't change, then adjust allocations accordingly to achieve those targets; the way the spreadsheet was set up would achieve the opposite.

The first chart and tables looks at macro-allocation; the information at the opening of each of these entries. The second chart and table breaks equities down into the 9 factors listed above. The third chart and table focuses on individual funds.

The first chart has two tables. The first table breaks equities into small-, mid-, and large-cap. The second table breaks equities into value, blend, and growth. All I do with these tables is make sure the targets are roughly 30 percent for each.

The second chart has one table. It breaks equities into the 9 factors listed above. I've changed this table to be a data entry table, where I input the targets for each factor. This way, no matter what changes int he Morningstar data, the values for this table won't change.

The third chart lists the individual funds to calculate the current percent they occupy in the portfolio. Those percentages form the basis for the calculations of the other tables and charts to get the current numbers. Here's where it gets weird.

There are 8 other tables to help with the Morningstar data. 

One set of 4 tables is used to calculate the current percentages for each of the 9 factors. The way it works is the table takes the current percent the fund occupies and breaks it down based on the Morningstar data. Let's say a fund is occupying 10 percent of the portfolio and Morningstar says that 5 percent of the fund is in small-cap value, the percent in the box would be 0.5 percent. Let's say another fund occupies 20 percent of the portfolio and Morningstar says 10 percent of the fund is in small-cap value, the percent in the box would be 2 percent. The number in the current, small-cap value box in the second table would be 2.5 percent.

The other set of 4 tables is used to populate a fifth, related table. The 4 tables take a percent I enter and uses the Morningstar data to populate the 9 factor boxes. Then there is a fifth table that shows what the percent for each factor would be if each fund was at the given total target percent.
