Apologies for being a couple of days late. Let me explain. No, there is too much. Let me sum up.

1. Short-term assets show high because I’m no longer employed and have kept my remaining paychecks as (mostly) cash. Coincidentally, the various funds have been up, which means short-term assets aren’t insanely above their target percent.
2. I’ll be moving the 401k and Health Savings Account money to the proper custodian. This will reduce the extended market proportion a decent amount. This should reduce the mid-cap percentage, which is what we’re going for.
3. I’m ramping up on various writing and similar projects, which has been relaxing and cathartic. Also hoping it will generate a little income. Will keep you posted. 
4. I’m thinking I’ll add syndication feeds to this site soon as well. This will let you see all updated content by subscribing to the feed or viewing a feed page.
