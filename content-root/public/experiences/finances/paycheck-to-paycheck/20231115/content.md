Apologies for being a couple of days late. Let me explain. No, there is too much. Let me sum up.

1. Short-term assets show high because I’m no longer employed and have kept my remaining paychecks as (mostly) cash. Coincidentally, the various funds have been up, which means short-term assets aren’t insanely above their target percentage.
2. I’ll move the 401k and Health Savings Account money to the proper custodian. This will reduce the extended market proportion by a decent amount. This should reduce the mid-cap percentage, which is what we’re going for.
3. I’m ramping up on various writing and similar projects, which has been relaxing and cathartic. I also hope it will generate a little income. I will keep you posted. 
4. I think I’ll also add syndication feeds to this site soon. This will let you see all updated content by subscribing to the feed or viewing a feed page.
