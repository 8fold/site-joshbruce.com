This paycheck is a bit interesting. 

I was able bring in a full contribution to the taxable brokerage account. I increased my 401k contribution by 1 percent. I’m also spending way more money on nutrition.

Last month the index funds were going up in value, which meant I was putting away more cash. I also needed to recover from the trip in July, and we had another trip in September. Then the index funds started to fall and cash, as a percentage of the overall portfolio went down. I hadn’t spent a lot of money, so I was able to do a full contribution. It took a couple of days to invest all the money due to fluctuations in price, but it’s all pretty much there now. Still appreciating [the universal portfolio](/essays-and-editorials/finances/the-universal-portfolio/) as an approach along with [my buying strategy](/experiences/finances/investment-policy/#investments).

One contribution to the 401k at the higher level was enough to make so I could lower the contribution percent by 1 percent. My last paycheck of the year won’t be able make the full contribution based on the percentage. I’m digging that. With that said, I’m behind my timing goal regarding my net worth, and I’m still plugging away.

I started using a virtual nutrition coach, if you will, called [MacroFactor](/examinations/macrofactor-food-tracker/). My food bill has almost doubled. While I’m not appreciating the expense, my [health and wellness](/experiences/health-and-wellness/) are improving, which is kind of the point. Seriously, my expenses this year are so odd for me.

Housing is still in the number 1 spot. But, not by much as of this writing, because medical expenses are right on its heels (as in less than 2 percent away). Travel is actually holding the third place position over 4 percent behind medical expenses. Food is fourth, a solid 2 percent behind travel.

So weird.
