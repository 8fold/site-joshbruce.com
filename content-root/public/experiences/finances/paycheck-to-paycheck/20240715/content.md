Don't let the short-term assets being at 5 percent fool you.

1. The American Stock Market has been on a tear for the last few weeks, especially on the 16th. 
2. As of right now, all the funds I'm invested in are down less than 2 percent from their 52-week highs. 
3. An interesting part is that the S&P 500, extended market, and total market are all up more than 26 percent from their 52-week lows. 
4. The small-cap, small-cap value, and multi-factor funds are all up roughly 24 percent from their 52-week lows.

I stopped contributing to the extended market fund in 2022 because I wanted to move out of that position. However, I didn't want to do it when it had a capital loss. Because I have the holding in multiple accounts, each purchased at different times, each individual holding has a different percentage gain (or loss).

A few days ago, I was looking at my Traditional [Individual Retirement Arrangement](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/individual-retirement-arrangements-iras) (because that's what the [.United States Internal Revenue Service] calls it). It was showing a gain of 8,000 USD. That's because this holding was purchased when I rolled over my employer-sponsored retirement account in 2022 and again in 2023.

I'm still working through [rebalancing behavior](/experiences/finances/investment-policy/#rebalancing-the-portfolio), and I'm also taking this opportunity to try to build out a selling strategy.

So far, it seems like it will work out, at least until I feel confident to pick a withdrawal rate and do something on a regular cadence like [Frank Vasquez](https://www.riskparityradio.com).

The short version, detailed in the next section, is I placed 3 limit orders for the extended market fund. I set them to stick around for 60 days; when buying, I do daily. That means if the per share priced reaches what I set it to within the next 60 days, the sale executes. On the first day, the first limit order sold. A few days later the other two did as well.

Funny enough, the total unrealized gains for the extended market fund are still just over 8,000 USD. So, put it 3 more limit orders using the closing price for July 17th.

And, I’ve been using the buying strategy to buy into the small-cap value fund. Strictly speaking, this isn’t rebalancing, but it’s similar.

## How I buy and sell

I’ve been experiencing a lot of different scenarios recently, which has me modifying how I buy and sell things.

1. If my income streams result in a positive cash flow, I’ll automatically dollar-cost average into tax-advantaged accounts as much as possible (up to the maximum). Further, excess cash after paying bills will be used to purchase more investments in a taxable brokerage account.
2. If my income streams result in a negative cash flow, I won’t contribute to tax-advantaged accounts. Further, I’ll avoid selling investments as much as possible and reasonable. Finally, I’ll avoid purchasing investments in my taxable brokerage account.
3. I follow the [spending from savings](/experiences/finances/personal-budget/#spending-savings) protocol from my Personal Budget to purchase things in my taxable brokerage account. Further, I follow the purchasing protocol outlined in my [Investment Policy statement](/experiences/finances/investment-policy/#investments).

The buying strategy mainly looks at short-term assets in the portfolio, and whether a given vehicle was up or down the previous day.

The selling strategy hasn’t been captured yet. It hasn’t been captured because I haven’t been in a scenario to think about and experiment with it much.

At its core, the selling strategy is working like this:

1. Decide a dollar amount to sell from a given vehicle.
2. Place 3 limit orders based on the closing price from the previous day:
  - closing price plus 1 percent,
  - plus 2.5 percent, and
  - plus 5 percent.






I left my previous employer when I hit my first Coast [.Financial Independence](FI) number. This timing wasn’t intentional, but that is how it played out. It’s been about 8 months since I left. So far, my net worth is still above that Coast FI number.

The EPUB version of [*Time: Mastering the Mundane*](https://mastering-the-mundane.com/books/#time-mastering-the-mundane) is available for purchase in more stores now. The audiobook is also uploaded and available on [Scribl](https://www.scribl.com/books/EEDEB8/Time). We’ll see how long it takes for the audiobook to get pushed to other stores, and the free podcast.

I’m definitely shifting gears to *Space: Mastering the Mundane* as the next book instead of *Money: Mastering the Mundane*.

I’m also considering increasing the search for employment beyond self-employment.

This month was also an anomaly for expenses mainly due to [the collapse](https://joshbruce.com/experiences/health-and-wellness/historical-summaries/202406/).

## Downsizing 

Received payment for the Mac mini from [Sell Your Mac](https://www.sellyourmac.com). 

Shipped the Time Capsule. I’ve never used this company to buy back my hardware; so, we’ll see how it goes.

Canceled the Verizon 5G Home Internet. Waiting for the return boxes to arrive to send the equipment back. I also need to call them now because the person who canceled the service said I’d receive a check for unused services. However, instead I received a bill stating I was past due, but only owed 18 [United States Dollars](USD) instead of 60 USD.

Becca and I are starting a vacation in a couple of days. Spending a few days with Katrina, my other intimate partner. We’ll head up to Canada for [Mysterium](https://mysterium.net). Then we’ll drive back down through New England. We have some friend and site visits planned along the way.
