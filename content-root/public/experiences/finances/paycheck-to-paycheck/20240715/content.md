Don't let the short-term assets being at 5 percent fool you.

1. The American Stock Market has been on a tear for the last few weeks, especially on the 16th. 
2. As of right now, all the funds I'm invested in are down less than 2 percent from their 52-week highs. 
3. An interesting part is that the S&P 500, extended market, and total market are all up more than 26 percent from their 52-week lows. 
4. The small-cap, small-cap value, and multi-factor funds are all up roughly 24 percent from their 52-week lows.

I stopped contributing to the extended market fund in 2022 because I wanted to move out of that position. However, I didn't want to do it when it had a capital loss. Because I have the holding in multiple accounts, each purchased at different times, each individual holding has a different percentage gain (or loss).

A few days ago, I was looking at my Traditional [Individual Retirement Arrangement](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/individual-retirement-arrangements-iras) (because that's what the [.United States Internal Revenue Service] calls it). It was showing a gain of 8,000 USD. That's because this holding was purchased when I rolled over my employer-sponsored retirement account in 2022 and again in 2023.

I'm still working through [rebalancing behavior](/experiences/finances/investment-policy/#rebalancing-the-portfolio), and I'm also taking this opportunity to try the selling strategy.

## How I buy and sell












I left my previous employer when I hit my first Coast [.Financial Independence](FI) number. This timing wasn’t intentional, but that is how it played out. It’s been about 8 months since I left. So far, my net worth is still above that Coast FI number.

The EPUB version of [*Time: Mastering the Mundane*](https://mastering-the-mundane.com/books/#time-mastering-the-mundane) is available for purchase in more stores now. The audiobook is also uploaded and available on [Scribl](https://www.scribl.com/books/EEDEB8/Time). We’ll see how long it takes for the audiobook to get pushed to other stores, and the free podcast.

I’m definitely shifting gears to *Space: Mastering the Mundane* as the next book instead of *Money: Mastering the Mundane*.

I’m also considering increasing the search for employment beyond self-employment.

This month was also an anomaly for expenses mainly due to [the collapse](https://joshbruce.com/experiences/health-and-wellness/historical-summaries/202406/).

## Downsizing 

Received payment for the Mac mini from [Sell Your Mac](https://www.sellyourmac.com). 

Shipped the Time Capsule. I’ve never used this company to buy back my hardware; so, we’ll see how it goes.

Canceled the Verizon 5G Home Internet. Waiting for the return boxes to arrive to send the equipment back. I also need to call them now because the person who canceled the service said I’d receive a check for unused services. However, instead I received a bill stating I was past due, but only owed 18 [United States Dollars](USD) instead of 60 USD.

Becca and I are starting a vacation in a couple of days. Spending a few days with Katrina, my other intimate partner. We’ll head up to Canada for [Mysterium](https://mysterium.net). Then we’ll drive back down through New England. We have some friend and site visits planned along the way.
