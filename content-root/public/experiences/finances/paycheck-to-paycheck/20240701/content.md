I left my previous employer when I hit my first Coast [.Financial Independence](FI) number. This timing wasn’t intentional, but that is how it played out. It’s been about 8 months since I left. So far, my net worth is still above that Coast FI number.

The EPUB version of [*Time: Mastering the Mundane*](https://mastering-the-mundane.com/books/#time-mastering-the-mundane) is available for purchase in more stores now. The audiobook is also uploaded and available on [Scribl](https://www.scribl.com/books/EEDEB8/Time). We’ll see how long it takes for the audiobook to get pushed to other stores, and the free podcast.

I’m definitely shifting gears to *Space: Mastering the Mundane* as the next book instead of *Money: Mastering the Mundane*.

I’m also considering increasing the search for employment beyond self-employment.

## Downsizing 

Received payment for the Mac mini from [Sell Your Mac](https://www.sellyourmac.com). 

Shipped the Time Capsule. I’ve never used this company to buy back my hardware; so, we’ll see how it goes.

Canceled the Verizon 5G Home Internet. Waiting for the return boxes to arrive to send the equipment back. I also need to call them now because the person who canceled the service said I’d receive a check for unused services. However, instead I received a bill stating I was past due, but only owed 18 [United States Dollars](USD) instead of 60 USD.

Becca and I are starting a vacation in a couple of days. Spending a few days with Katrina, my other intimate partner. We’ll head up to Canada for [Mysterium](https://mysterium.net). Then we’ll drive back down through New England. We have some friend and site visits planned along the way.
