{!! data !!}

Another pretty uneventful paycheck.

Still contributing via dollar cost averaging to the 401k and [.HSA](Health Savings Account). Prepared for the future full contribution to the Roth [.IRA](Individual Retirement Account). Didn’t do anything to the taxable brokerage account.

High bills from all things [health and wellness](/experiences/health-and-wellness/). Though I did finally get the dual energy CT scan of my foot; no evidence of uric acid crystals, so, toe problem is not gout. I have a marker in my bloodwork indicating a predisposition to inflammatory disease. Rheumatologist thinks is psoriasis, and I’ll be following up with a dermatologist to possibly get a biopsy done.
