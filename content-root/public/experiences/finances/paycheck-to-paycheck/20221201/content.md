This one stung a bit.

Went to Chicago the last week of November for work. Decided to use an Airbnb instead of a hotel for internet considerations. Pretty sure I won’t get reimbursed there.

Doctor bills related to foot also started showing up. While not as much as the appendectomy, 100 [.United States Dollars](USD) a few times can add up pretty quickly.

So, yeah. 

Paid off the cards. Put money in the tax-hold account. Put a bit in savings. Had nothing left to put toward the taxable account. 

Could be worse.

## Closing M1 Finance

I’m still trying to reach a tighter balance at the fund level before actively contributing here.

## Update on the dip

 No extra cash going toward the dip.
