The 401k rollover came in. I started buying into the small-cap value fund. It was up on day one, and I stuck with purchase at market price with 2 limit orders; only the market order went through. On day 2, it was up again; the market order and one of the limit orders went through. On day 3, it went down; all three orders went through.

I don't want to drop below 9 percent short-term assets, so on days 2 and 3, I only committed enough cash to bring the portfolio back in balance. On day 4, the short-term assets weren't a high enough percentage of [The Univeral Portfolio](/essays-and-editorials/finances/the-universal-portfolio/) to purchase more shares.

This puts short-term assets just above the maximum for the portfolio, which is fine because it should resolve itself in a couple of weeks when I pay rent.

## Other projects

In the meantime, I'm still passively looking for another job, as I'm pretty sure everyone is on vacation anyway.

8fold is ramping up on the various projects right now. There are four:

1. [Mastering the Mundane](https://mastering-the-mundane.com)
2. [The Irreverent Agilists](https://the-irreverent-agilists.com)
3. [Alexander Midknight](https://amidknight.com)
3. HnS Works (website coming soon)

If you'd like to support the projects individually, [8fold has an Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/8fold) page with all the projects as collectives:

1. [Mastering the Mundane](https://opencollective.com/mastering-the-mundane)
2. [The Irreverent Agilists](https://opencollective.com/the-irreverent-agilists)
3. [Alexander Midknight](https://opencollective.com/alexander-midknight)
4. [HnS Works](https://opencollective.com/hns-works)

We're not sure how those will go, but they're there. Definitely long-tail while working on the short-tail things.
