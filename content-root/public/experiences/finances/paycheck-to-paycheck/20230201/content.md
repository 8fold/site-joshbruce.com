I had cash in the settlement account after the previous check. The multi-factor fund was up the previous day, and on Tuesday, I did another market price, 2 cents over, and 1 percent down set of limit orders. 2 of the 3 executed. The multi-factor fund was down by the end of the day.

The available balance wouldn’t let me purchase a full share at 2 cents above the previous ending price, so I didn’t put any orders in on Wednesday.

For the regular investing round, when I got my paycheck, the multi-factor fund was up, and I did the market price, 2 cents over, and 1 percent down limit orders—only 2 of the 3 executed.

I’m starting to understand what normal fluctuations feel like day-to-day. I’m not checking the Stocks app as often as I was. Daily has turned into every few days. With that said, it’s multiple times on those days.

I’m going to be closing down my Personal Capital account. It’s been nice. They have a good tool. I signed up for the free consultation, and now they’re calling me regularly to follow up. I don’t want to waste their time, and the call felt less like a consultation and more like a sales pitch. Beyond that, I’ve written about the limitations or discrepancies I’m finding with their tool.

The tool itself definitely seems like a loss leader to get more assets under management. I can’t fault them for that. However, I’m looking for advice and examination when I want or need it, preferably for a one-time fee per visit. I'm not looking for someone to charge me regularly to manage my money.

Ultimately it comes down to trust and frustration. I've received a lot of bad money advice over the years. I'd rather only have myself to blame or praise if things go poorly or well, respectively.

## Allocations

The extended market fund is still creeping up. I’m going to change the allocation in my 401k next paycheck. I’m thinking of jumping straight to the 50-50 split. 

My [.Health Savings Account](HSA) and Roth [.Individual Retirement Account](IRA) are solely in the extended market fund, and that means it will continue to creep up as an overall portion of the portfolio.

The multi-factor fund is maintaining value pretty well and is on track to hits its target allocation soon.

## Skill improvement

I purchased a one-year subscription to Grammarly.

## Spent way too much money

I am still recovering from the increased amount spent. We haven’t paid rent this year, and miscellaneous expenses, transportation, and electronics-related things account for over half my spending in 2023 so far.

Food is next, with regular groceries and dining out neck and neck.

## Goal setting and breaking down
