I had cash in the settlement account after the previous check. The multi-factor fund was up the previous day and on Tuesday I did another market price, 2 cents over, and 1 percent down set of limit orders. 2 of the 3 executed. The multi-factor fund was down by the end of the day.

The available balance wouldn’t let me purchase a full share at 2 cents above the previous ending price, so I didn’t put in any orders Wednesday.

## Allocations

## Skill improvement

## Health and wellness

## Spent way too much money

## Death in the family
