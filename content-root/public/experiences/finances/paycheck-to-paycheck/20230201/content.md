# February 1st, 2023 paycheck

I had cash in the settlement account after the previous check. The multi-factor fund was up the previous day, and on Tuesday, I did another market price, 2 cents over, and 1 percent down set of limit orders. 2 of the 3 executed. The multi-factor fund was down by the end of the day.

The available balance wouldn’t let me purchase a full share at 2 cents above the previous ending price, so I didn’t put any orders in on Wednesday.

For the regular investing round, when I got my paycheck, the multi-factor fund was up, and I did the market price, 2 cents over, and 1 percent down limit orders—only 2 of the 3 executed.

I’m starting to understand what normal fluctuations feel like day-to-day. I’m not checking the Stocks app as often as I was. Daily has turned into every few days. With that said, it’s multiple times on those days.

I’m going to be closing down my Personal Capital account. It’s been nice. They have a good tool. I signed up for the free consultation, and now they’re calling me regularly to follow up. I don’t want to waste their time, and the call felt less like a consultation and more like a sales pitch. Beyond that, I’ve written about the limitations or discrepancies I’m finding with their tool.

The tool seems like a loss leader to get more assets under management. I can’t fault them for that. However, I’m looking for advice and examination when I want or need it, preferably for a one-time fee per visit. I'm not looking for someone to charge me regularly to manage my money.

Ultimately it comes down to trust and frustration. I've received a lot of bad money advice over the years. I'd rather only have myself to blame or praise if things go poorly or well, respectively. 

## Allocations

The extended market fund is still creeping up. So I’m going to change the allocation in my 401k next paycheck. I’m thinking of jumping straight to the 50-50 split. 

My [.Health Savings Account](HSA) and Roth [.Individual Retirement Account](IRA) are solely in the extended market fund, which means the fund will continue to creep up as an overall portion of the portfolio.

The multi-factor fund is maintaining value well and is on track to hit its target allocation soon.

## Skill improvement

I purchased a one-year subscription to Grammarly.

## Spent way too much money

I am still recovering from the money spent. 

Housing isn't taking the lead like it usually does. Miscellaneous is in the lead. With February rent, housing is the second—half of where miscellaneous is. 

Food is next, with regular groceries and dining out neck and neck.

## Goal setting and milestones

I've been thinking about the [goals for the portfolio](/experiences/finances/investment-policy/) and how I might break things down a bit. There are the dollar targets, which is great. However, I want to look at shorter time horizons and milestones.

First, I want to earn more in dividends than reward points from credit cards in a given year. This goal should inspire two behaviors; less spending and more savings.

Second, I want to earn more in dividends from the taxable and tax-deferred accounts than from reward points, excluding the tax-free accounts (Roth IRA, HSA, and similar). The same behavior changes as the previous.

Third, I want to earn more in dividends from the taxable accounts than from reward points, excluding the tax-deferred and tax-free accounts.

Fourth, I want to earn more in dividends from credit union accounts than from reward points. This goal excludes all investment accounts. I'm not sure this is mathematically possible.

At some point, it would be nice if a third of what went toward investments was purchased using dividends from the investments.
