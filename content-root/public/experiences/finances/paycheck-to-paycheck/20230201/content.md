# February 1st, 2023 paycheck

I had cash in the settlement account after the previous check. The multi-factor fund was up the previous day and on Tuesday I did another market price, 2 cents over, and 1 percent down set of limit orders. 2 of the 3 executed. The multi-factor fund was down by the end of the day.

The available balance wouldn’t let me purchase a full share at 2 cents above the previous ending price, so I didn’t put in any orders Wednesday.

I’m starting to feel like I understand what normal fluctuations feel like day-to-day. I’m not checking the Stocks app as often as I once was. Daily has turned into every few days. With that said, it’s multiple times on those days.

## Allocations

The extended market fund is still creeping up. I’m going to change the allocation in my 401k next paycheck. I’m thinking of jumping straight to the 50-50 split. 

My [.Health Savings Account](HSA) and Roth [.Individual Retirement Account](IRA) are solely in the extended market fund, and that means it will continue to creep up as an overall portion of the portfolio.

The multi-factor fund is maintaining value pretty week and is on track to hits its target allocation soon.

## Skill improvement

Purchased the one-year subscription to Grammarly.

## Spent way too much money

Still recovering from the heavy money spend. We haven’t paid rent this year and miscellaneous expenses, transportation, and electronics related things account for over half my spending in 2023 so far.

Food is next with regular groceries and dining out neck and neck.

## Goal setting and breaking down
