Short-term assets have dropped and stayed below their minimum for the first time since May. But it’s 0.01 percent; not the end of the world. I’m about 1,500 [.United States Dollars](USD) low for my estimated 3-month runway. Again, not the end of the world. I am, however, thinking these will be the triggers to place sell orders, as it seems to be working well for now.

So, here’s the working criteria:

1. Sell orders will be placed on Fridays. (This coincides with paying bills and running numbers.)
2. The asset being sold will be the 1 with the greatest long-term gains.
3. Sell orders will use 3 limit orders set to expire in 60 days.
    - The first order will be for 15 percent of the target total and at a price at least 1 percent higher than the previous day’s closing. 
    - The second will be for 35 percent and at 2.5 percent higher the previous day’s closing.
    - The third will be for 50 percent at 5 percent higher.
4. If the runway isn’t enough to cover estimated 3-months’ runway, I MUST put in orders to hit the difference to achieve 3-months’ runway, if they all execute.
5. If short-term assets are below their minimum, I MAY put in orders to return short-term assets to their target percent of the portfolio, if they all execute.
6. If the runway is less than 3-months AND short-term assets are below their minimum, I MUST put in orders to hit the difference to achieve 3-months’ runway, if they all execute.

So far I’ve put in 9 sell orders; 4 of them have not executed. 1 is set to expire at the end of September, 1 is set to expire on the 23rd of October, and 2 is set to expire on the 30th October. Most of them are the 50 percent at 5 percent increase compared to the price per share at the time the order was placed.

## Downsizing

I sold the treadmill, which removes a larger item from the apartment.

Becca is making good strides as well.
