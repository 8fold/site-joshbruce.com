The last time showed an image like the one above was in the [June 15th, 2022 paycheck](/experiences/finances/paycheck-to-paycheck/20220615/). In that write up it was to illustrate the plateau and how the different charts could emotionally make me react due to volatility. This time I'm showing it more as a way of illustrating a benefit to rebalancing (selling high and buying low) and buying what is down the farthest (through dollar cost averaging contributions and extra contributions, if possible).

I've stopped contributing to my M1 Finance account. I've been contributing to my taxable brokerage account and [buying the dip](/experiences/finances/personal-budget/#spending-savings) every week for the past few weeks. And, I was rebalancing my 401k at my former employer. So, the M1 Finance account acts something like a control as it's invested in pretty much the same things as everywhere else.

As of this writing, my main M1 Finance Pie is down roughly 20 percent; that's the control, no new contributions. My main Taxable Brokerage Account is down roughly 12 percent. The 401k at my former employer is down roughly 9 percent.

Further, looking at the the FI Experiments below we can see that the Mark 0 portfolio has been down roughly 15 percent while the Mark 1 portfolios have been down roughly 12 percent; roughly one-third to one-fourth less than the Mark 1, which is where we are with the M1 Finance Pie compared to either of the other accounts.

So, the advice from those I pay the most attention to I feel has been cross-checked and verified:

1. Choose your portfolio allocation and stick with it for as long as it makes sense.
2. Buy what's down either in value, percent of portfolio, or both whether selling anything or not.
3. Sell what's high to buy what's low, withdraw to cash, or both.
4. Have more than one security in your portfolio; cash does count, however, I'm going with having multiple non-cash securities.
	5. Further, specifically have assets with low or negative correlation. The small- and mid-cap funds did drop further than the large-cap, which dropped more than the multi-factor fund.

## Rolling over the 401k

Still holding the 401k with my previous employer. The S&P 500 fund is a bit, specifically enough to counteract the drawdown in the other two funds. Instead of selling them, I decided to sell those gains and buy into the other two funds.

So, I'm selling roughly 2,000 [.United States Dollars](USD) of the S&P 500 to buy 1,000 USD each of the total small- and total mid-cap index funds.

The rationale for this is I've seen how much rebalancing through contributions has been helping with taxable accounts during this downturn and I believe it will continue to be helpful here.

Because as individual shares increase in value, I will have more of them, which, in theory, means I won't have to wait for the market rebound as far as I would have otherwise.

## FI experiments

Details are in the [January 15th, 2022 paycheck](/finances/paycheck-to-paycheck/20220115/#fi-experiments).

The hypothesis is when the Mark 0.0 mix is down, itâ€˜ll be down more than the others. Further, when the Mark 0.0 is up, the others will be up and not too far behind the Mark 0.0. We will track the change since the previous paycheck as well as the change since we started tracking January 2022.
