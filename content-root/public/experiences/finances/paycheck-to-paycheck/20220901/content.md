The last time I showed an image like the one above was in the [June 15th, 2022 paycheck](/experiences/finances/paycheck-to-paycheck/20220615/). In that write up it was to illustrate the plateau and how the different charts could emotionally make me react due to volatility. This time I'm showing it more as a way of illustrating a benefit to rebalancing (selling high and buying low) and buying what is down the farthest (through dollar cost averaging contributions and extra contributions, if possible).

I've stopped contributing to my M1 Finance account. I've been contributing to my taxable brokerage account and [buying the dip](/experiences/finances/personal-budget/#spending-savings) every week for the past few weeks. And, I was rebalancing my 401k at my former employer. So, the M1 Finance account acts something like a control as it's invested in pretty much the same things as everywhere else.

As of this writing, my main M1 Finance Pie is down roughly 20 percent; that's the control, no new contributions. My main Taxable Brokerage Account is down roughly 12 percent. The 401k at my former employer is down roughly 9 percent; rebalancing with no new contributions.

Further, looking at the [FI Experiments](#fi-experiments) below we can see that the Mark 0 portfolio has been down roughly 15 percent while the Mark 1 portfolios have been down roughly 12 percent; roughly one-third to one-fourth less than the Mark 1, which is where we are with the M1 Finance Pie compared to either of the other accounts.

So, the advice from those I pay the most attention to I feel has been cross-checked and verified:

1. Choose your portfolio allocation and stick with it for as long as it makes sense.
2. Buy what's down either in value, percent of portfolio, or both whether selling anything or not.
3. Sell what's high to buy what's low, withdraw to cash, or both.
4. Have more than one security in your portfolio; cash does count, however, I'm going with having multiple non-cash securities.
	1. Further, specifically have assets with low or negative correlation. The small- and mid-cap funds did drop further than the large-cap, which dropped more than the multi-factor fund.

I did manage to add the HSA and 401k for my new employer to Personal Capital. So, hoping that works moving forward.

I'm feeling pretty comfortable that I have the information and practical experience now to go ahead and start selling off the M1 Finance account to eventually close it down; reduce the paperwork and level of effort needed for publishing each of these posts.

## Closing out M1 Finance

Odd as it may sound, I’m going to start contributing to the M1 Finance account again to begin the close-out process.

After looking at it, and seeing how buying the dip has been somewhat helpful over these last few paychecks, there are a couple of realizations I've come to.

The idea of tax-loss harvesting is beyond my scope of control and understanding to the point where I don't want to touch selling anything that's down while I'm still in accumulation mode; wash sale rules and guidance are just too strange (see [Investopedia Tax-Loss Harvesting article](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/taxes/08/tax-loss-harvesting.asp). The other piece of this is seeing the possibility of shortening the affects of a drawdown by continuing to purchase and reinvesting dividends.

So, here's the plan, well, here's the setup.

I have the main Pie with four Slices, which are each Pies; potentially confusing, but that's how [M1 Finance](https://help.m1.com/hc/en-us/articles/115012405467-Invest-in-a-second-Pie) works. One Slice is for the [FI Experiments](#fi-exeriments), again, this will be the last article with that section for now. The second and third slice were for longer-term future expenses (using the Mark 1 [asset allocation](/experiences/finances/investment-policy/#asset-allocation)); specifically insurance deductibles (see [The Foo by The Money Guy Show](/examinations/money-guy-foo/)) and electronics because I only tap insurance deductibles every 5 to 7 years and purchase electronics at roughly the same time-scale. The fourth Slice was using the Mark 0 asset allocation to save toward [van-life](/experiences/van-life/) (most likely 5 to 10 years out as well). Initially each Slice was 25 percent of the base Pie and I would contribute money to each Slice individually.

The problem I ran into was that throwing money at M1 Finance was causing the portfolio to get out of balance related to negative correlation and alternative asset classes; at least compared to where I want to be right now. Further, when I had my taxes done, it was one more statement I needed to wait on, there was also a correction required even though it didn't change the outcome of my taxes. Finally, it's one more account for me to check every paycheck.

I already changed the target percent for the FI Experiments Slice to be 1 percent of the main Pie, changed the percent for the insurance deductibles and electronics Slices to be 2 percent each, and I set the van-life Slice to be 95 percent. After that change, all of these Slices are far out of balance.

Now, here's the plan.

I’ve added the multi-factor fund to my equal equities Pie that was 34 percent total stock market and 66 percent extended market. Now it’s 60-30-10 in total stock market, extended market, and multi-factor, respectively. Changing it at the Pie level means every Pie that has it as a Slice was updated as well; convenient that. 

When I do my regular contributions I’ll send the money to M1. Because the other three slices are way over their targets, no money will go there; going to the one farthest below it’s target instead—the van-life Slice. Further, since the multi-factor fund is also below its target it’ll be filled up first. (Dividends will be reinvested into the main Pie in the same manner as regular contributions.)

When I buy the dip, it’ll most likely go to the M1 account but toward a specific Slice because, as of this writing, I’m less than one percent too low in the total stock market fund and [the guidelines](/experiences/finances/personal-budget/#spending-savings) suggest that I shouldn’t do something that causes the portfolio to go farther out of balance.

This should solve the issue of too much going toward the alternatives and negative correlation securities while I’m trying to be the Mark 0 asset allocation.

I’m going to sell funds as they reach a positive return state; either shifting the cash elsewhere or putting it into the main Pie (or a slice within that pie.

For example, the commodity funds are up over 30 percent at the moment. I’ll sell those after capturing the FI Experiment data for this post. The gains should be a low dollar amount, so, the long-term will be at a 0 percent tax bracket while the long-term will be treated like regular income.

We can’t avoid making mistakes or taking losses entirely and I’m glad to be doing it now while the dollar amounts aren’t substantial compared to my total lifestyle cost or cash flow ability.

## Rolling over the 401k

Still holding the 401k with my previous employer. The S&P 500 fund is a bit, specifically enough to counteract the drawdown in the other two funds. Instead of selling them, I decided to sell those gains and buy into the other two funds.

So, I'm selling roughly 2,000 USD of the S&P 500 to buy 1,000 USD each of the total small- and total mid-cap index funds.

The rationale for this is I've seen how much rebalancing through contributions has been helping with taxable accounts during this downturn and I believe it will continue to be helpful here.

Because as individual shares increase in value, I will have more of them, which, in theory, means I won't have to wait for the market rebound as far as I would have otherwise.

## Recalibrating the portfolio (again)

I recently made the time to figure out [Morningstar's ticker tool](https://www.morningstar.com/funds/xnas/vtsax/portfolio) and updated the spreadsheet to show me my equities in the grid of small-, mid-, and large-cap compared to value, growth, and blend.

This has led me to adjust the targets for each of the individual funds I'm invested in.

I appreciate Personal Capital's grid-view, however, they sub-divide for alternatives and Real Estate Investment Trusts in a way that wasn't giving me the picture I wanted.

Now, instead of relying on Portfolio Visualizer, that seems to only look at small-, mid-, and large-cap, without adding in value, growth, and blend; or, relying on Personal Capital's grid-view that seems to bucket things in a way my brain isn't calibrated to, I can use the Morningstar grid data for each individual security. 

My current, personal blended portfolio looks something like this for targets:

- Large-cap value: Roughly 8 percent.
- Large-cap growth: Roughly 15 percent.
- Large-cap blend: Roughly 12 percent.
- Mid-cap value: Roughly 8 percent.
- Mid-cap growth: Roughly 8 percent.
- Mid-cap blend: Roughly 14 percent.
- Small-cap value: Roughly 13 percent.
- Small-cap growth: Roughly 7 percent.
- Large-cap bland: Roughly 15 percent.

The previous list includes the 401k from my previous employer, which I'm planning to roll into my Traditional Individual Retirement Account; selling off two funds to zero. The mix after doing the roll over will look something like this:

- Large-cap value: Roughly 8 percent.
- Large-cap growth: Roughly 15 percent.
- Large-cap blend: Roughly 11 percent (changed, lower).
- Mid-cap value: Roughly 8 percent.
- Mid-cap growth: Roughly 9 percent (changed, higher).
- Mid-cap blend: Roughly 12 percent (changed, lower).
- Small-cap value: Roughly 13 percent.
- Small-cap growth: Roughly 7 percent.
- Large-cap bland: Roughly 15 percent.

Right now, I'm severely underweight in the multi-factor fund and overweight in the extended market fund.

I'll continue buying the multi-factor fund via M1 Finance and my recalibrated total United States equities Pie; while still following the plan laid out in the [Closing out M1 Finance section](#closing-out-m1-finance) and my [investment policy](/experiences/finances/investment-policy/). 

Note: Even though I’m shifting the targets for the funds in a way that makes the individual securities out of balance, the macro-allocations are still in balance.

Feel a bit like [Tony Stark](https://youtu.be/y0brSA1cyzw) at the moment:

> Get ready for a major remodel, fellas, we're back in hardware mode.

### Process improvement

Right now, when I make these posts, to get the lead-in data at the top, I have to jump through a fair amount of hoops:

1. I update all the values for my various holdings.
2. This populates a table I export to a comma-separated values file.
3. I upload the file to Portfolio Visualizer.
4. Then I update a different table with the percent equities and the small-, mid-, and large-cap breakdowns.
5. Updating that table updates the table I use for posting here.
6. I do a cross-check every once in a while with Personal Capital by adding all the small-, mid-, and large-cap percentages to see if I'm totally off somewhere.

I’ve adjusted the setup to use the Morningstar data for portfolio spread within the matrix. This means I only need to update the values and the rest is handled for me. Every year I’ll check the Morningstar data to verify I’m still using the correct percentages.

This is going to save me a fair amount of time. This improvement, coupled with this being the last entry with the [FI Experiments section](#fi-experiments) should reduce update time by a few minutes at the least.

I’m also considering displaying the breakdown of value, growth, and blend for each market-cap weight.

## FI experiments

This data was taken on August 22nd, 2022 and will be the last in the series for now.

Details are in the [January 15th, 2022 paycheck](/finances/paycheck-to-paycheck/20220115/#fi-experiments).

The hypothesis is when the Mark 0.0 mix is down, it‘ll be down more than the others. Further, when the Mark 0.0 is up, the others will be up and not too far behind the Mark 0.0. We will track the change since the previous paycheck as well as the change since we started tracking January 2022.
