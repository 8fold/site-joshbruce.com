The last time I showed an image like the one above was in the [June 15th, 2022 paycheck](/experiences/finances/paycheck-to-paycheck/20220615/). In that write up it was to illustrate the plateau and how the different charts could emotionally make me react due to volatility. This time I'm showing it more as a way of illustrating a benefit to rebalancing (selling high and buying low) and buying what is down the farthest (through dollar cost averaging contributions and extra contributions, if possible).

I've stopped contributing to my M1 Finance account. I've been contributing to my taxable brokerage account and [buying the dip](/experiences/finances/personal-budget/#spending-savings) every week for the past few weeks. And, I was rebalancing my 401k at my former employer. So, the M1 Finance account acts something like a control as it's invested in pretty much the same things as everywhere else.

As of this writing, my main M1 Finance Pie is down roughly 20 percent; that's the control, no new contributions. My main Taxable Brokerage Account is down roughly 12 percent. The 401k at my former employer is down roughly 9 percent; rebalancing with no new contributions.

Further, looking at the [FI Experiments](#fi-experiments) below we can see that the Mark 0 portfolio has been down roughly 15 percent while the Mark 1 portfolios have been down roughly 12 percent; roughly one-third to one-fourth less than the Mark 1, which is where we are with the M1 Finance Pie compared to either of the other accounts.

So, the advice from those I pay the most attention to I feel has been cross-checked and verified:

1. Choose your portfolio allocation and stick with it for as long as it makes sense.
2. Buy what's down either in value, percent of portfolio, or both whether selling anything or not.
3. Sell what's high to buy what's low, withdraw to cash, or both.
4. Have more than one security in your portfolio; cash does count, however, I'm going with having multiple non-cash securities.
	1. Further, specifically have assets with low or negative correlation. The small- and mid-cap funds did drop further than the large-cap, which dropped more than the multi-factor fund.

I did manage to add the HSA and 401k for my new employer to Personal Capital. So, hoping that works moving forward.

I'm feeling pretty comfortable that I have the information and practical experience now to go ahead and start selling off the M1 Finance account to eventually close it down; reduce the paperwork and level of effort needed for publishing each of these posts.

## Closing out M1 Finance

Odd as it may sound, I’m going to start contributing to the M1 Finance account again to begin the close-out process.

After looking at it, and seeing how buying the dip has been somewhat helpful over these last few paychecks, there are a couple of realizations I've come to.

The idea of tax-loss harvesting is beyond my scope of control and understanding to the point where I don't want to touch selling anything that's down while I'm still in accumulation mode; wash sale rules and guidance are just too strange (see [Investopedia Tax-Loss Harvesting article](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/taxes/08/tax-loss-harvesting.asp). The other piece of this is seeing the possibility of shortening the affects of a drawdown by continuing to purchase and reinvesting dividends.

So, here's the plan, well, here's the setup.

I have the main Pie with four Slices, which are each Pies; potentially confusing, but that's how [M1 Finance](https://help.m1.com/hc/en-us/articles/115012405467-Invest-in-a-second-Pie) works. One Slice is for the [FI Experiments](#fi-exeriments), again, this will be the last article with that section (using [various asset allocations](/experiences/finances/investment-policy/#asset-allocation)). The second and third slice were for longer-term future expenses (using the Mark 1 asset allocation); specifically insurance deductibles (see [The Foo by The Money Guy Show](/examinations/money-guy-foo/)) and electronics because I only tap insurance deductibles every 5 to 7 years and purchase electronics at roughly the same time-scale. The fourth Slice was using the Mark 0 asset allocation to save toward [van-life](/experiences/van-life/) future. Initially each Slice was 25 percent of the base Pie and I would contribute money to each Slice individually.

The problem I ran into was that throwing money at M1 Finance was causing the portfolio to get out of balance related to negative correlation and alternative asset classes. Further, when I had my taxes done it was one more statement I needed to wait on, there was also a correction required even though it didn't change the outcome of my taxes. Finally, it's one more account for me to check every paycheck.

I already changed the percent for the FI Experiments Slice to be 1 percent of the main Pie, changed the percent for the insurance deductibles and electronics Slices to be 2 percent each, and I set the van-life Slice to be 95 percent.

Now, here's the plan.

I’ve added the multi-factor fund to my equal equities Pie that was 34 percent total stock market and 66 percent extended market. Now it’s 60-30-10 in total stock market, extended market, and multi-factor, respectively. Changing it at the Pie level means every Pie that has it as a Slice was updated as well; convenient that. When I do my regular investing it will go to the multi-factor fund in the van-life Pie for a while because I’m not rebalancing by selling anything and they’re the farthest off from their targets. When I buy the dip I can by the total stock market fund directly; at least for now. When I reinvest dividends it’ll go to the main Pie to be distributed as needed. 

I'm going to sell the commodity funds, which are up over 30 percent at the moment. This will result in short-term capital gains, which will be taxed at my regular income tax, however, it should only be around 100 USD. When I sell it’ll go into the cash account and I’ll reinvest it to the main Pie; just like if it were dividends.

As Pies have positive value compared to the cost basis, I’ll sell them; not sure what I’ll do with the cash.

## Rolling over the 401k

Still holding the 401k with my previous employer. The S&P 500 fund is a bit, specifically enough to counteract the drawdown in the other two funds. Instead of selling them, I decided to sell those gains and buy into the other two funds.

So, I'm selling roughly 2,000 USD of the S&P 500 to buy 1,000 USD each of the total small- and total mid-cap index funds.

The rationale for this is I've seen how much rebalancing through contributions has been helping with taxable accounts during this downturn and I believe it will continue to be helpful here.

Because as individual shares increase in value, I will have more of them, which, in theory, means I won't have to wait for the market rebound as far as I would have otherwise.

## FI experiments

Details are in the [January 15th, 2022 paycheck](/finances/paycheck-to-paycheck/20220115/#fi-experiments).

The hypothesis is when the Mark 0.0 mix is down, it‘ll be down more than the others. Further, when the Mark 0.0 is up, the others will be up and not too far behind the Mark 0.0. We will track the change since the previous paycheck as well as the change since we started tracking January 2022.
