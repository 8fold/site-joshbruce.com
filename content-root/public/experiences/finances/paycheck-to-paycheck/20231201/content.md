This feels a bit awkward, given that I'm currently unemployed. But that's part of life sometimes.

I'm writing a lot. 

I do still have my own company, which is breaking even at the moment despite not being able to pay myself for it.

I wake up, do the morning routine, and get to writing. I write until about noon and shift to doing an hour or more of work on 8fold. Then, I spend the rest of the day looking for my next role.

If you're curious and would potentially like to support the writing efforts, see the list of projects on [8fold's Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/8fold/projects) page.

Regarding finances, still a bit heavy on cash, but it's dropped within range. Still waiting for the rollover for the 401k and HSA. I don't know how much my burn rate has changed because I need to have a full month without pay.

Beyond that, going to keep plugging away.
