I’m continuing to stick with the sale protocol. That said, I realized something the other day; I can’t always wait for short-term assets to drop below 3 percent.

Given the way [The Universal Portfolio](/essays-and-editorials/finances/the-universal-portfolio/) functions, there are two primary ways short-term assets will drop below their target. The first is through continued income, and purchasing short-term, non-cash assets or holding onto cash. The second is for the other assets in the portfolio to grow in value such that the short-term assets occupy a smaller percentage of value in the portfolio.

Given I’m currently experimenting with a draw down portfolio and no steady income of any significance, if the short-term assets drop below their target, it will be from increase in resell value, and time to take risk off the table. However, my bills do not care if other things are dropping in value, which means short-term assets will be occupying a higher percentage of the portfolio. Therefore, something else is needed.

I decided to add a table with 12 rows in it. Each row is how much I spent in that month. Then I added 3 header rows to the table. The first is the average for the past 12 months, the second is the median, and the third is the median multiplied by 3.

Then I added a conditional highlight to the sell table. If my current short-term asset value is less than the 3-month burn rate, the cash cell goes red to let me know. Further, if the short-term asset percentage is less than the minimum, the cell goes red.

So, if other asset groups are going crazy, I can take some of the risk off the table. Further, if things are dropping in value, I can try and weather the drop until an opportune moment presents itself to sell a bit.

At present, my short-term assets are less than my 3-month burn rate. However, it’s less than one-third of the burn rate; so, not rushing to sell just yet.

As of now, one of my limit orders to sell from last time is still waiting. If the per share value of the asset increases roughly 10 percent, the order should execute. The order is set to expire at the end of September.

Having said that, between now and then, if my short-term assets fall to my 2-month burn rate, I’ll probably place three more limit orders. Again, just experimenting and exploring.

As of this writing, the value of the portfolio is around what it was when I left my previous employer. So, from a pure value perspective, I have not spent money since leaving my previous employer.

## Downsizing

Not much to report on downsizing.

Given Becca and I got back from vacation not too long ago and then got hit with COVID, not surprising.

The plan is to still convert this apartment to a one bedroom by making space for my stuff in the main room, and getting rid of what I can.

I’m hoping to schedule some viewings at some of the regular apartment complexes to get a feel for them and the surrounding areas.


## Income streams

[Time (Mastering the Mundane)](https://mastering-the-mundane.com/books/time-mastering-the-mundane/) moved up a price tier. Still working on the print version.

Have a coaching call scheduled for this coming week.

I did pick up an interview for a gig. We’ll see how that goes. It’s software development, not coaching, but for the right spot, I’d be willing.
