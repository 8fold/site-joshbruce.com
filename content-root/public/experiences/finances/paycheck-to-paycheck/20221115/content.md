For a while I was experiencing a bug with Vanguard. In short, the percentages were stuck. For example, the Traditional [.Individual Retirement Account](IRA) showed down almost 50 percent, despite the account being positive. Each account and the aggregate had problems.

It seems the issue was fixed.

Overall, the combined total value of the Vanguard accounts is down around 6 percent. Down 10 for the taxable, up 40 for the Traditional IRA, and down 14 for the Roth IRA.

The Main Pie at M1 Finance still shows down around 30 percent.

Again, I think this demonstrates what we hope to see when you’re able to keep contributing. 

This was an interesting go with investing. For the most part, the market closed on up notes, which the 15, 35, 50 would divided among fractional shares, 2 cents over the previous close, and 1 percent down from the previous close. On the first 3 days of trading usually only one order would excite. On day 4, however, all three executed, which means more shares and still around the same price because the fluctuations weren’t that crazy day-to-day.

I’m considering this another confirmation of this approach for both psychological and practical purposes.

## 401k rollover

Definitely feeling good about the decisions here. This section probably won’t be here moving forward.

## Closing M1 Finance

I’m still trying to reach a tighter balance at the fund level before actively contributing here.

## Update on the dip

 No extra cash going toward the dip.

## Changes to diet and spending
