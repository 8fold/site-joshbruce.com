{!! data !!}

Even though two data points aren’t enough to call something a trend, my burn rate for the last two months has been just under 2,500 [.United States Dollars](USD). I haven’t drastically changed my lifestyle to accomplish that. If I feel like eating out, I do. If I want some snack foods or to grab something not on the grocery list, I do. If that number does set itself as a trend, I have about 3 months of short-term assets left before I’d need to sell some growth assets.

That said, short-term assets are below 6 percent, which means I’m going to be increasing the priority on the job search. I still plan to spend until noon writing. The change here will be that after noon, I don’t write.

Sometimes I’d get up late or get on a roll and I’d either finish a writing timer after noon or I’d keep writing. I’m going to see about making noon a hard line.

After noon I’ll set a 60-minute timer and submit a résumé to at least one gig, and create or update the various job boards I use.

Once the 60-minute timer is up, I’ll continue working on [Mastering the Mundane](https://mastering-the-mundane.com) services and marketing along with HnS Works.

I was hoping to be in a position where I felt comfortable closing the M1 Finance account last year. That may happen this year, depending on how the cash situation goes. As of this writing, if I sold it, that would give me another 2 or 3 months.
