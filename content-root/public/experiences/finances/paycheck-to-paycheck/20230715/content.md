# July 15th, 2023 paycheck

Back from vacation. All of this paycheck went to paying credit cards from the vacation. I also had to transfer money from the runway account, but that’s why it’s there.

I did buy the small-cap value fund because dividends had accumulated and I transferred 100 dollars; all 3 orders executed.

Cash is low and the market is going up. This should let me experiment with this portfolio contribution approach more. Basically building up my short-term assets again. To make sure it’s understood, I’m still straight dollar cost averaging into the 401k and health savings account. Further, depending on where short-term assets are as a percentage of the portfolio, I may not hold cash in the individual retirement accounts either.

With that said, be greedy when others are fearful and fearful when others are greedy, and the fear and greed index shows extreme greed (haven’t seen that in a hot minute). All the things are going up in value except cash, so, portfolio is working as expected.

To be fair, the money side of life seems to be going well, and the process is automating most of it. My [health and wellness](/experiences/health-and-wellness/) does not seem to be going as well, and my focus is there. In short, I’m having good body days and bad body days. Unfortunately, I’m having more bad days than good at the moment, and there doesn’t seem to be a pattern beyond I moved the previous day. I’m a pretty kinetic human, so being limited in my ability to do basic movements (like walk a mile) is a serious drop in quality of life.

2 things from the brighter side are:

1. Right now it’s overall discomfort punctuated by low-level pain, which is better than debilitating pain.
2. It’s an interesting experience to add to the collection of experiences in this thing called life.
