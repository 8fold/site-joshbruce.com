On vacation, spending a lot of money, and that’s okay. Spend lavishly on the things you love and cut ruthlessly on the things you don’t. We made it to [Mysterium](https://mysterium.net) after spending a few days in Seattle hanging with friends.

I did purchase the small-cap value fund, though not a lot; 2 of the 3 orders executed.
