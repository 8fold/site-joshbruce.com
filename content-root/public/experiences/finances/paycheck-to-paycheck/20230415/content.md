A few years ago, my [primary credit union](/experiences/finances/personal-budget/#assets) started offering a high interest rate on the first 500 [.United States Dollars](USD) in their savings account; conditions apply—they’re my primary institution, so I always meet the criteria. The interest rate was 7 percent for a couple of years, and has been 5 percent for the last few. This year it was increased to 7 percent and the amount it applied to doubled to 1,000 USD. I took some money from my profit account and moved it back to that savings account.

The exchange was closed due to a holiday. The small-cap value fund was up and I placed orders accordingly when I reopened.

Making progress on a web shop integration and experience for a couple of sites.

Other than that, not much going on.
