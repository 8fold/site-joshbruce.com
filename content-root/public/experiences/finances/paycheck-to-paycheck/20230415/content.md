A few years ago, my [primary credit union](/experiences/finances/personal-budget/#assets) started offering a high interest rate on the first 500 [.United States Dollars](USD) in their savings account; conditions apply—they’re my primary institution, so I always meet the criteria. The interest rate was 7 percent for a couple of years, and has been 5 percent for the last few. This year it was increased to 7 percent and the amount that applied to doubled to 1,000 USD. I took some money from my profit account and moved it back to that savings account.
