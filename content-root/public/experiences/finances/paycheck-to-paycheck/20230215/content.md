I had cash in the settlement account after [the previous check](/experiences/finances/paycheck-to-paycheck/20230201/). The multi-factor fund was up the previous day, I placed the following limit orders:

1. market price; executed.
2. 2 cents over; executed.
3. 1 percent down; executed.

This day was interesting. Of course, the market price order executed, [partial shares are a thing at Vanguard](https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/article/investing-in-vanguard-etfs). The price per share of the fund dropped slowly throughout the day. Then, as soon as the 1 percent down order was executed, the price per share shot back up over the market price I paid.

[Vanguard is also opening up the margin game](https://investor.vanguard.com/client-benefits/margin) for those using their platforms. Leveraged investing goes against my [financial character](/experiences/finances/#practices). So, I won’t be taking advantage of that. Good to see Vanguard increasing feature parity with other platforms while maintaining the spirit with which the company was founded; at least my understanding of it.

I updated the [investment policy](/experiences/finances/investment-policy/#investments) to reflect the order strategy I’ve been iterating on over the last few paychecks that I’m appreciating greatly.

When I received my paycheck the multi-factor fund was down, and I placed the following limit orders:

1. 2 cents over; didn’t execute.
2. 1 percent down; didn’t execute.
3. 2 percent down; didn’t execute.

Will try again on Monday.

I’m appreciating the funds I’ve chosen a bit more as I watch the price per share move. The S&P 500, total stock market, and extended market funds are all closely correlated; if one is going down, they all do. However, on multiple occasions the multi-factor fund has been stable or going up while the other three go down; not dramatically, but still. Further, the extended market has also been down while the others have been up.

These differences in fluctuations affirm the [slight correlation-based diversification](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/asset-correlations?s=y&symbols=VFMF%2CVTI%2CVOO%2CVXF&timePeriod=2&tradingDays=60&months=36) between the funds. The total market and S&P 500 funds are 100 percent correlated. The extended market fund is roughly 95 percent correlated with those two and the multi-factor fund. And the multi-factor fund is roughly 95 percent correlated with the other three.
