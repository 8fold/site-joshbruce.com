I had cash in the settlement account after [the previous check](/experiences/finances/paycheck-to-paycheck/20230201/). The multi-factor fund was up the previous day, I placed the following limit orders:

1. market price; executed.
2. 2 cents over; executed.
3. 1 percent down; executed.

This day was interesting. Of course, the market price order executed, [partial shares are a thing at Vanguard](https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/article/investing-in-vanguard-etfs). The price per share of the fund dropped slowly throughout the day. Then, as soon as the 1 percent down order was executed, the price per share shot back up over the market price I paid.

[Vanguard is also opening up the margin game](https://investor.vanguard.com/client-benefits/margin) for those using their platforms. Buying on margin, leveraged investing, goes against my [financial character](/experiences/finances/#practices). So, won’t be taking advantage of that. Good to see Vanguard increasing feature parity with other platforms while maintaining the spirit with which the company was founded; at least my understanding of it.

I updated the [investment policy](/experiences/finances/investment-policy/#investments) to reflect the order strategy I’ve been iterating on over the last few paychecks that I’m appreciating greatly.
