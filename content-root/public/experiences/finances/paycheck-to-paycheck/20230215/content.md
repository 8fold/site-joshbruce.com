I had cash in the settlement account after [the previous check](/experiences/finances/paycheck-to-paycheck/20230201/). The multi-factor fund was up the previous day, I placed the following limit orders:

1. market price; executed.
2. 2 cents over; executed.
3. 1 percent down; executed.

This day was interesting. Of course, the market price order executed, partial shares are a thing. The price per share of the fund dropped slowly throughout the day. Then, as soon as the 1 percent down order was executed, the price per share shot back up over the market price I paid.
