I reduced the target percents for the small- and mid-cap funds in the 401k at my former employer by 2 percent each. I increased the target percent for the other four funds in my portfolio by 1 percent each. The multi-factor fund is the only one below its minimum after doing so, therefore, still building its balance up.
