# September 15th, 2022 paycheck

{!! data !!}

Increased the contribution to the 401k. With the previous paycheck my spreadsheet said I wasn’t going to make to the annual contribution limit. Going to keep tabs on it to see if I can adjust it back down before the end of 2022.

My dining out is still my second highest cost, which I was trying to reduce this year. The goal was to be at least less than my regular food. My third highest expense is medical from the appendectomy. My fourth highest is regular food. My regular food should overtake the medical this paycheck, making housing and food (regular plus dining) my second highest expense.

My goal is for total expenses to be 50 percent or less of my take home pay. Of those expenses, I’d like shelter and food (regular and dining) to be around 50 percent or less. And, I’d like dining to be less than regular on the food front.

## Making up for spent time

There’s no way to turn back time at the moment, so, I’m trying to make up for it.

There are two approaches I’ve seen to do this:

1. Try and find things with high rates of return, often in the [speculation realm](/essays-and-editorials/finances/concepts/#investing-speculating-and-gambling-arent-the-same).
2. Get a bigger shovel, so to speak.
3. Both is a third option, though I’m not sure if what I’m doing falls into that category.

My savings rate is about 70 percent at the moment. By all projections, most of my net worth the time I reach 53 will be from my contributions, not growth or dividends. Definitely a bigger shovel.

With that said, for the most part, I’m starting as if I were 20. My rationale is that some of the investments will have a 20 to 30 year gestation period; the number of years from age 20 to the age 50 or 60. Time is relative from the moment the money’s invested.

What I’m not doing is taking on more risk through speculative investing. Short-term growth and returns is rare and takes too much active participation and research. Patiently impatient.

At some point, before I hit financial independence, I might lower my savings rate. However, for now, I’m wanting to front-load as much as I can without sacrificing my happiness; this includes taking advantage of this downturn as much as I can without jeopardizing my ability to cash flow all purchases and emergencies.

If my finances are “exciting” I feel like I’m doing it wrong.

## Changing my diet

Appendicitis one month and a gout flare during the next. But, before those, I was looking at changing my diet anyway; in part to prepare for [van life](/experiences/van-life/).

While I don’t think diet can fix everything, I do believe it can help a lot more than many doctors I run into give it credit for.

First up is I want to maximize movement and quality of life.

Next is less cooking with a pan and fire. No microwave and minimal oven; already covered. My meals right now all use one frying pan and no oven or microwave, so, not too drastic a change there. Over half my food intake when I prepare it is raw fruits and vegetables; the pan is literally to cook eggs and meat.

Third is the foods included in the diet must be easy to procure. If I can only get that food from one store, it shouldn’t be there. Of course, these should also be foods I enjoy.

Fourth I want the majority of my calories, macronutrients, and micronutrients to come from food, not supplements. I’m o e of those people who says, “They’re called supplants for a reason.” Right now I take a daily multivitamin, a fish oil pill, collagen, and creatine. I’d like to reduce and specialize more there.

Fifth I’d like to reduce my purine intake. Gout, from what I understand, is a form arthritis. It’s caused by a build up of Utica acid in the blood. This build up can collect and form these microscopic spikes in joints; the spikes are gout. You may have gout and never experience a flare. A gout flare causes inflammation, pain, and reduced mobility in the joint. It is believed that purines increase the amount of Utica acid in the blood. There’s medication you can take to reduce uric acid, you can also modify your diet, or both. Right now my uric acid levels are on the high end of the normal range; I’m on the medication and haven’t altered my diet yet.

Sixth I’d like to be more alkaline and less acidic with my diet. While this should also help with the uric acid, I also subscribe to acidic diets leading to inflammation. Further, while inflammation as an immune response has benefits, I don’t think inflammation as a regular, constant state is good.

So, we’ll see where this goes. Maybe it’ll be a new area of the site; I’ve been considering it before all this happened and just haven’t pulled the trigger.

## Personal Capital

During the previous paycheck I sold the commodity funds I had. At the beginning of this paycheck period I noticed they were still being listed as part of Personal Capital.

I started looking into it further and it appears that Personal Capital is delayed compared to my tracking with the spreadsheet.

They’re including the entire balance of my new 401k, so, not differentiating between vested and not vested, which makes some sense. Despite that advantage The net worth is off by about 4 percent lower than what I show from the spreadsheet.
