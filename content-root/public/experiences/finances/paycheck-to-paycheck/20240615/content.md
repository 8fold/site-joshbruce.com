The index funds have been dipping a bit from their recent high. That means I got lucky, and closed the M1 Finance account without losing much, if anything from my cost basis. That said, it’s fascinating to look at cost per share today compared to the highs and lows of the last 52 weeks, which is something I have in my spreadsheet.

The total [.US](United States) stock market index fund is down 0.25 percent from its 52-week high, which roughly 25 percent up from its 52-week low. The S&P 500 index fund is also down 0.25 percent compared to the 52-week high, and up roughly 25 from the 52-week low.

Both of those index funds tilt toward growth. Further, they weighted based on market capitalization. Finally, they are primarily driven by about 10 companies. Therefore, not really surprising that their shifts are so similar.

Meanwhile, the extended market fund is down 5 and up 21. The small-cap that includes more growth is down 5 and up 18. The small-cap value is down 8 and up 15. I’m taking this as indicating folks are favoring growth again (or still).

Last is the multi factor fund, which is down 4 and up 20.

*Money: Mastering the Mundane* is proving to be problematic. I think it needs some more marination time. So, I’ll be shifting to *Space: Mastering the Mundane* as the 60-minute per day book. Still work through the audiobook for [*Time: Mastering the Mundane* page](https://mastering-the-mundane.com/books/time-mastering-the-mundane/) (mostly it’s just making sure the rendered files meet Scribl’s criteria).

## Downsizing 

I’m selling my Mac mini.

We’ve switched to using the internet service provided by the apartment. So, I’ll be selling the Time Capsule, canceling the Verizon 5G home internet, and returning the equipment.

We’re trying to empty out the back office and basically treat this two bedroom apartment as if it were a one bedroom.

I stopped using the microwave, which just means I’m eating the green peas cold. They start frozen and I have them thaw in the fridge. They actually taste a lot better that way to me. So, for meals, I use a blender, fridge, and freezer.

Cutting back on smoking is difficult, but maybe not for the reasons you’d think. I don’t get “the shakes” or anything. Mainly it’s coming down to the cues. Because the thought of smoking is more cue-based as opposed to urge-based, I classify mine more as habit than addiction.

Unfortunately, the cues are inherent to my daily activities. Luckily, I’m a professional, and have only had one day in the past couple of weeks where I didn’t stay within the daily allotted number of cigarettes.

I’ve been looking at one bedroom places in the area while also looking at folks living the van life. It seems like we could get close to the monthly cost of someone being a bit more extravagant with van life from a cost perspective. Also looking at housesitting as a form of house hacking because there’s only so much we can cut before it becomes antithetical to a happy life.

I’ve also applied to a couple of jobs. Still not actively looking and definitely not doing the scattershot approach. Of course, that means if I don’t get them, the chances I’ll be bummed is greater.
