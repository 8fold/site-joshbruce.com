*Time: Mastering the Mundane* is available on [Scribl](https://www.scribl.com/books/EEDEB8/Time). In theory this means it will be available just about anywhere you can purchase electronic books. I’ve opted into Crowdpricing, which means the price is set by “the market” based on downloads and reviews. [Crowdpricing Everywhere](https://www.scribl.com/info/crowdpricing-everywhere), which is why it will be available “everywhere.” This also means that, for now, it’s free. So, give it a try and review, and maybe I’ll start earning income from it, which would be wonderful. I’ll be updating the [Mastering the Mundane](https://mastering-the-mundane.com/books/time-mastering-the-mundane/) website.

I’m recording and editing the audiobook.

I’m working on the *Money: Mastering the Mundane* book. Admittedly, it’s kicking my butt. A lot of false starts. The same thing happened with *Time: Mastering the Mundane*, so I’m chalking it up to being part of the process. The main hiccup is balancing between the necessary and the “professional.”

I’m still not actively looking for employment, which in “professional” terms means working for someone else. That said, I am accepting [coaching](https://mastering-the-mundane.com/coaching-and-mentoring/) and [bookkeeping and professional organizing](https://mastering-the-mundane.com/services/) clients.

As of this writing, I do not have consistent revenue from third parties. But, I’m still in a decent financial position from a net worth and relatively liquid asset perspective.

So, we’ll see how this goes.
