# November 1st, 2023 paycheck

{!! dateblock !!}

{!! data !!}

The big news is that I decided to leave my employer. That means I won’t have a steady income until I find another gig.

I should receive two more paychecks; the last paycheck and the cashing out of my paid time off balance. This should result in a spike in short-term assets.

In the meanwhile I’m focusing on writing another book, with three more on summer.
