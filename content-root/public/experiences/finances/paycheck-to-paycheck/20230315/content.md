# March 15th, 2023 paycheck

{!! data !!}

I modified the data to use [the universal portfolio](/essays-and-editorials/finances/the-universal-portfolio/) language. Technically it was always using the same categories. I'm debating on combining the growth assets into one data point.

I updated the experience for the main page of this series. Instead of the full list of entries, I broke previous years into disclosures and only list the current year.

I verified that I can contribute the full amount to my Roth [.Individual Retirement Account](IRA), I transferred the remaining amount to prepare to purchase the extended market fund. The extended market fund was up the previous day, so I placed the following limit orders: 

1. market price; executed.
2. 2 cents under; executed.
3. 1 percent down; did not execute.

There was enough remaining to place another set of orders. The extended market fund was down the previous day, so I placed the following limit orders:

1. 2 cents over; executed.
2. 1 percent down; did not execute.
3. 2 percent down; did not execute.

Extended market fund was up the previous day. Had enough remaining to place the following orders:

1. Market; executed.
2. 2 cents over; executed.
3. 1 percent down; executed.

Not enough cash left in the Roth IRA settlement account to place more orders.

I made the maximum contribution to the Roth IRA. This brought my short-term assets down to 3 percent of the portfolio. 3 percent in the low [guardrail](/essays-and-editorials/guidelines-and-guardrails/). I decided most of the paycheck would stay as short-term assets.

I contributed to the 401k automatically. I contributed the regular amount to the [.Health Savings Account](HSA). I put the amount I’d normally invest into the runway account. I put the regular amount to savings and the tax account. And I paid the credit cards. The remaining amount I transferred to the Federal Money Market account at Vanguard; as if I were going to place the limit orders.

All of the funds were down the previous day. However, when I entered the amount I could spend and the current price of the multi-factor fund, I couldn’t buy a full share at 2 cents above market price; if the fund had been up the previous day I could because, per the [investment policy statement](/experiences/finances/investment-policy/#investments) I would’ve been in dollar-based investing territory. So the cash will just stay there instead in one of the savings accounts at the credit. It’ll still earn dividends.

## Dollar cost averaging 

This paycheck was an interesting learning experience from a dollar cost averaging perspective. 

All of the [.Exchange Traded Funds](ETFs) I hold are down compared to their 52 week high. The multi-factor fund is down less than 2 percent, the others are still down over 10 percent.

I stopped actively contributing to my [M1 Finance](https://m1.com ) account a while ago, the main pie showed a total return of negative 18 percent. Meanwhile, I’ve continued to dollar cost average and buy the dip in my [Vanguard](https://investor.vanguard.com/home) accounts is at a total return of 2 percent.

To be clear, this observation isn’t about the platform, it’s about the behavior. 

Continuously buying means any upward movement from a valley becomes amplified compared to if I had put the same amount of money in at a peak and didn’t contribute again.

Regardless, with the current strategy and plan, most of the value of my portfolio will be from contributions I’m making, not interest or growth. I knew this when I started. With that said, it’s nice to see the portfolio has a positive return overall and, at least in the case of Vanguard is at an all time high for total return.

## New year, new me?

Every year, I reflect on The Motivators Exercise](/essays-and-editorials/motivators/). [My motivators](/experiences/the-self/#motivators-exercise-results/) changed slightly.

Process and acts of service moved open on the extended version. Therefore, I moved a connection above mastery. 

I may be expanding my conception of process to go beyond the order and operations of things and including the [guidelines and guardrails](/essays-and-editorials/guidelines-and-guardrails/). While they aren’t strictly about the order of things or the steps taken, they do create the container.

I may change the motivator to reflect that.

## Fucking toe

It’s been a while since I had any health issues.
