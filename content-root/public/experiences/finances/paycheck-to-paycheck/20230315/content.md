{!! data !!}

I modified the data to use [the universal portfolio](/essays-and-editorials/finances/the-universal-portfolio/) language. Technically it was always using the same categories. I'm debating on combining the growth assets into one data point.

I updated the experience for the main page of this series. Instead of the full list of entries, I broke previous years into disclosures and only list the current year.

I verified that I can contribute the full amount to my Roth [.Individual Retirement Account](IRA), I transferred the remaining amount to prepare to purchase the extended market fund. The extended market fund was up the previous day, so I placed the following limit orders: 

1. market price; executed.
2. 2 cents under; executed.
3. 1 percent down; did not execute.

There was enough remaining to place another set of orders. The extended market fund was down the previous day, so I placed the following limit orders:

1. 2 cents over; executed.
2. 1 percent down; did not execute.
3. 2 percent down; did not execute.

Extended market fund was up the previous day. Had enough remaining to place the following orders:

1. Market; executed.
2. 2 cents over; executed.
3. 1 percent down; executed.

Not enough cash left in the Roth IRA settlement fund to place more orders.
