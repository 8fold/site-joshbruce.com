I received a letter from my old electric company. Suspecting it was a bill, I didn’t wait to get upstairs before opening it. It was a check. Some type of refund for being over-billed I guess. It was for less than 2 dollars. It cost more to send me the check than the check was for. But that’s how we seem to be with all things accounting. Accuracy at any cost.

I remember my anxiety when I was a teller at the credit union and had a cash drawer. At the end of the day we had to balance our drawers. I was a nickel off one day. I checked the drawer like five more times. I asked lead if I could just throw in a nickel, she said no.

But, hey, 1 more dollar.

I also had my initial appointment with the tax lady. My adjusted gross income was such that I could contribute the full amount to my Roth [.Individual Retirement Account](IRA). I took 80 percent of the balance of the tax account and put enough in the savings account to max out the Roth IRA. The remainder of the 80 percent from the tax account went to the runway account.

I updated the [personal budget](/experiences/finances/personal-budget/#tax-account) which used to say:

> I can transfer up to 80 percent of the pool to the savings account. This move puts money back into circulation within the system; see next section.

Where “the pool” was based on a calculation that didn’t actually match the intent and added an unnecessary layer of complexity. With that said, I did reduce the percentage from 80 to 70.
