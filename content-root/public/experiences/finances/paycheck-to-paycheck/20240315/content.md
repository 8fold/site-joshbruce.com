The Runway account is now at 0 [.United States Dollars](USD). So, I’m dipping into the Profit account.

I have some simmering leads on consulting work. Still applying to some W2-permanent and -contract work. Not landing anything. Still seeing a lot of folks getting laid off in the technology space.

Traveling to a conference right now. We’re stopping over in Denver, Colorado. That’s given me the chance to take Becca on a Josh backstory adventure. We’re driving to Portland, Oregon. Then we’ll drive back to Louisville, Kentucky.

So, road trip!

From a financial perspective, though, starting to feel a bit of pressure. Not from a “Oh my god I could become homeless again” but more like a “I don’t want to have to sell some things from the taxable brokers account.”

Going to just keep plugging away and see how it goes.
