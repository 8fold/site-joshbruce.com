## Update on the dip

As I continue with the founds I’m appreciating their similarities and differences. On the day-to-day none of them moves dramatically different than the others; [macro-allocation principle](/essays-and-editorials/finances/concepts/#the-three-principles-of-investing)—they’re all United States equities. With that said they are all down different amounts from their 52 week high and their share price is different enough to keep it interesting.

The S&P 500 fund is at around 300 [.United States Dollars](USD) per share and is down around 18 percent. The total stock market fund is around 200 USD and down 19 percent. The extended market fund is about 140 USD and down about 29 percent. And, the multi-factor fund is at 95 USD and down 14 percent.

So, for the same price as one S&P 500 fund share, I could get just over 3 shares of the multi-factor fund. Further, the multi-factor fund, is playing a bit of a ballast position at the moment.

There was also a few times when the extended market dropped more than 30 percent, so, I couldn’t buy the dip with more of it, but I could still buy the other funds; except the multi-factor fund, which was down less than 10 percent. Makes me feel like, at least for now, that they’re low-correlation enough to allow for good automatic decision making on what to buy.

Pretty cool.  

## Purchasing ETFs at Vanguard

This was interesting to me. 

I was doing the [buy the dip](/experiences/finances/personal-budget/#spending-savings) thing with the multi-factor fund. I used the method described in the [previous paycheck](/experiences/finances/paycheck-to-paycheck/20220915/#purchasing-etfs-at-vanguard) and it was fascinating.

I’m making up numbers, but the gist is correct.

I went to put in a limit order. The price of a share was 100 USD and I set my purchase amount at 100.02 USD per share. The most recent bid price, however, was 100.50 USD; so, the order didn’t execute immediately and wouldn’t unless the price dropped far enough.

As the day progressed, the price dropped to the point that my order executed. As soon as I saw the limit order executed I made another market order to buy 90 USD worth of shares. The market order executed immediately for the price of 99 USD.

So, my initial order didn’t execute immediately, and the price dropped enough for it to execute. Then I was able to buy in for an even cheaper price right after that.

I’m calling that a win.

I don’t have enough experiences to make this part of my [investment policy statement](/experiences/finances/investment-policy/), but we’re getting there.
