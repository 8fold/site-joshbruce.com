## 401k rollover

I received the check from the 401k at my former employer.

I called Vanguard and was surprised to learn I could deposit the check using the mobile app instead of overnighting like I originally thought. The agent was awesome and did curb my expectations by telling me it could still take two weeks to hit my settlement fund. With that said, Vanguard has a policy based on account value when it comes to check deposits and transfers. Long story short, some of the money was available, however, all of it wouldn't be available until after 7 days. (I did ask Vanguard to update their user interface to be a bit more explicit about what's available and what's not available.)

It took two business days to hit my settlement fund. I spent those two business days (and the weekend) figuring out how I would disperse the cash.

I didn't want to repeat what happened to my [.Health Savings Accounts](HSA) this year. If you don't know, when the market started down its correction and bear market path, I maxed out my HSA for the year. Unfortunately, that was only the tip of the dip and I could have spread that out more evenly; lesson learned. That mistake, for lack of a better term, was the impetus behind creating the [spending savings protocols](/experiences/finances/personal-budget/#spending-savings).

This rollover falls under the "Too much cash" protocol because now the portfolio as a whole went from its target 6 percent cash, to 10 percent cash when I took the three funds at my former employer to 0, and is now around 40 percent cash. The too much cash protocol, as of this writing, basically allows me to put in as much as I want toward one or more securities. When I created it, I wasn't expecting it to be from a windfall-style scenario, so, I've updated the protocol to loosen the guardrails a bit; initially all the money had to go to a single security and now it can go toward multiple securities as long as it doesn't throw the portfolio out of balance.

With that said, I don't want to do it all in a single move; avoiding the HSA debacle from earlier in 2022. What I'm going to do instead is combining the buying a dip 90 day cool down protocols. I’ll be doing it daily and using half the cash in the account.

Here are the guardrails around this experiment.

Until the available cash is so low it just makes sense to do dollar-based (fractional share) purchases I'll only use limit orders. I'll only commit 50 percent of the available cash each day to creating the limit orders. Further, I'll create multiple, one day limit orders for each fund using the target equity mix as the guideline. Finally, each limit order will be based on the initial price when I start creating the orders for that fund for the day.

Who's ready for some numbers and an example?

The target percentage for each fund is:

1. 15 percent total stock market.
2. 47 percent extended market.
3. 25 percent multi-factor.
4. 13 S&P 500.

Let's say the available cash was 30,000 [.United States Dollars](USD). On day 1, I'd be able to commit 15,000 USD to purchasing shares.

If I was doing it straight, that would be:

1. 2,250 USD to the total stock market,
2. 7,050 USD to the extended market,
3. 3,750 USD to the multi-factor, and
4. 1,950 USD to the S&P 500.

Given the way limit orders work and the experience I had with the HSA though, I'd like to subdivide even more. So, instead of doing straight, I'm doing 3 limit orders for each fund. There's what I'll call a normal tier, a single-dip tier, and a double-dip tier:

1. The normal tier is what's quickly becoming the normal way I put in limit orders, which is the initial price plus 2 cents; using 13 percent of the available money for the fund.
2. The single-dip tier is 1 percent less than the initial price; using 33 percent of the available money for the fund.
3. The double-dip tier is 2 percent less than the initial price; using 53 percent of the available money for the fund.

Each tier is a different percent of the total amount committed; thank the maker for spreadsheet software.

Back to the 15,000 USD example. We'll only run through the total stock market fund to give you a sense of it; let's say the initial price of the total stock market was 100 USD per share and I have the 2,250 USD available to put toward it:

1. Normal tier at 100.02 USD per share with a maximum available of 292.50 USD I can put toward purchasing shares; 2 full shares in this case.
2. Single-dip tier at 90 USD per share with a maximum available of 742.50 USD; 8 full shares.
3. Double-dip tier at 80 USD per share with a maximum available of 1,125 USD; 14 full shares.

If the price rises above the 2 cents (0.0002 percent of the initial price in this case), none of the orders will execute. If the price stays at or below the 0.0002 percent threshold, the first order will most likely execute. If the price drops to 1 percent, the first and second orders should execute. If the price drops to 2 percent, all three orders should execute.

I say “should” because one or more people need to be on the other side of the trade selling shares at or below the price, and in the quantity, set by my
limit order. Luckily, the funds I’m using are fairly liquid.

### Day one results

The first day I ran this experiment I was still figuring out putting in multiple limit orders at once because I normally only do the one limit order and then a market order to finish up after the limit order executes, so, I didn't have the double-dip orders in place.

I definitely can see the thrill in day-trading a bit based on this first day.

I put in 8 limit orders. 4 for the the 2 cents above the initial price when I set them up and 4 for the 1 percent dip.

None of them executed when the market opened.

I was feeling a bit of excitement or anxiety as I was considering what I should do. Of course, my answer to myself was, "Nothing" but it definitely took a bit of convincing. The mantra became: No worries, if none of them execute today, you'll just do the same thing tomorrow.

The prices kept going up. I'd look at the Vanguard app about once an hour in between doing day-job things; I wanted to sit with why I felt compelled to look at least long enough for the desire to grow old and subside. Then, just before noon, I stopped looking. I ran to an appointment related to the whole gout thing and came back. Toward late afternoon, I looked.

Every one of my limit orders executed, except one. The multi-factor fund was still hovering above the 1 percent dip mark. That was a good feeling. Finished up the day and looked again; the last limit order executed.

All 8 limit orders executed. Further, if I had put in the double-dip tier limit orders, they would not have executed.

### Day two results

This was my buy the dip day, and I did; I went with the multi-factor fund. From a portfolio allocation-perspective, the multi-factor fund is the lowest next to the S&P 500. However, I have the S&P 500 and an extended market fund in the 401k at my current employer, so, want to avoid both of those and the total stock market is getting filled in through the redistribution of cash in the Traditional [.Individual Retirement Account](IRA). (Besides, and worth noting, the extended market fund is down over 30 percent compared to its 52 week high anyway; so, only regular, automated contributions for now.)

I updated the quick spreadsheet tables I threw together with the cash now available in the settlement fund and was able to put in 4 more limit orders. If all of these orders execute, then I'll need to wait until the 7 days are up and I can spend all the cash.

In the future, if I do this again and if Vanguard hasn't updated their user interface to be a bit more accurate and explicit with how much is available, I'll probably go with 25 percent instead of 50 percent and ask how much is actually available and use that number until everything becomes available.

## Closing M1 Finance

Main M1 Finance Pie is still down over 30 percent and I'm working through the 401k rollover, so, no money went this way.

## Update on the dip

As I continue with the four funds I’m appreciating their similarities and differences. On the day-to-day none of them moves dramatically different than the others; [macro-allocation principle](/essays-and-editorials/finances/concepts/#the-three-principles-of-investing)—they’re all United States equities. With that said they are all down different amounts from their 52 week high and their share price is different enough to keep it interesting.

The S&P 500 fund is at around 300 [.United States Dollars](USD) per share and is down around 18 percent. The total stock market fund is around 200 USD per share and down 19 percent. The extended market fund is about 140 USD and down about 29 percent. And, the multi-factor fund is at 95 USD and down 14 percent.

So, for the same price as one S&P 500 fund share, I could get just over 3 shares of the multi-factor fund. Further, the multi-factor fund, is playing a bit of a ballast role at the moment.

There was also a few times when the extended market dropped more than 30 percent, so, I couldn’t buy the dip with more of it, but I could still buy the other funds.

Pretty cool.

## Purchasing ETFs at Vanguard

This was interesting to me.

I was doing the [buy the dip](/experiences/finances/personal-budget/#spending-savings) thing with the multi-factor fund. I used the method described in the [previous paycheck](/experiences/finances/paycheck-to-paycheck/20220915/#purchasing-etfs-at-vanguard) and it was fascinating.

I’m making up numbers, but the gist is correct.

I went to put in a limit order. The price of a share was 100 USD and I set my purchase amount at 100.02 USD per share. The most recent bid price, however, was 100.50 USD; so, the order didn’t execute immediately and wouldn’t unless the price dropped far enough.

As the day progressed, the price dropped to the point that my order executed. As soon as I saw the limit order executed I made another market order to buy 90 USD worth of shares. The market order executed immediately for the price of 99 USD.

So, my initial order didn’t execute immediately, and the price dropped enough for it to execute. Then I was able to buy in for an even cheaper price right after that.

I’m calling that a win.

I don’t have enough experiences to make this part of my [investment policy statement](/experiences/finances/investment-policy/), but we’re getting there.
