## 401k rollover

## Closing M1 Finance

## Update on the dip

## Purchasing ETFs at Vanguard

This was interesting to me. 

I was doing the [buy the dip](/experiences/finances/personal-budget/#spending-savings) thing with the multi-factor fund. I used the method described in the [previous paycheck](/experiences/finances/paycheck-to-paycheck/20220915/#purchasing-etfs-at-vanguard) and it was fascinating.

I’m making up numbers, but the gist is correct.

I went to put in a limit order. The price of a share was 100 [.United States Dollars](USD) and I set my purchase amount at 100.02 USD per share. The most recent bid price, however, was 100.50 USD; so, the order didn’t execute immediately and wouldn’t unless the price dropped far enough.

As the day progressed, the price dropped to the point that my order executed. As soon as I saw the limit order executed I made another market order to buy 90 USD worth of shares. The market order executed immediately for the price of 99 USD.

So, my initial order didn’t execute immediately, and the price dropped enough for it to execute. Then I was able to buy in for an even cheaper price right after that.

I’m calling that a win.

I don’t have enough experiences to make this part of my [investment policy statement](/experiences/finances/investment-policy/), but we’re getting there.

## So, that happened

## Changes to diet and spending
