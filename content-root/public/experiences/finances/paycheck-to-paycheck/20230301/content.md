# March 1st, 2023 paycheck

I received a performance bonus. Bonuses go through the same workflow as a regular paycheck. I paid of the credit cards, put a percentage aside in case I owe taxes, and put a bit in the Runway account. I didn’t put anything toward the [.Health Savings Account](HSA) because it’s on a per paycheck cycle. I’m preparing to contribute a lump sum to my Roth [.Individual Retirement Account](IRA) and put enough in savings to finish maxing it out for 2022. The rest went to the multi-factor fund.

The fund was down the day before receiving the bonus, so I put in the following limit orders:

1. 2 cents above market price;.
2. 1 percent  down;.
3. 2 percent down;.
