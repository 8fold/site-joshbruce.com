# March 1st, 2023 paycheck

I received a performance bonus. Bonuses go through the same workflow as a regular paycheck. I paid of the credit cards, put a percentage aside in case I owe taxes, and put a bit in the Runway account. I didn’t put anything toward the [.Health Savings Account](HSA) because it’s on a per paycheck cycle. I’m preparing to contribute a lump sum to my Roth [.Individual Retirement Account](IRA) and put enough in savings to finish maxing it out for 2022. The rest went to the multi-factor fund.

The fund was down the day before receiving the bonus, so I put in the following limit orders:

1. 2 cents above market price; executed.
2. 1 percent down; didn’t execute.
3. 2 percent down; didn’t execute.

I had enough left from the bonus and the orders not executing that I placed another 3 limit orders:

1. 2 cents over; executed.
2. 1 percent down; executed.
3. 2 percent down; executed.

After recalibrating the values for the accounts I found the cash portion of the portfolio was occupying 7 percent of the portfolio’s value. This falls into the process I have to [90 day cool down](/experiences/finances/personal-budget/#spending-savings) under spending savings. I transferred money from savings and placed 3 more limit orders:

1. 2 cents over; executed.
2. 1 percent down; did not execute.
3. 2 percent down; did not execute.
