## 401k rollover

Hindsight being what it is, I'm actually pretty glad that I withdrew the funds from my 401k when I did. I was considering leaving it in until it was actually up again, but given what's happened with a deeper drop and my subsequent ability to purchase over time I think no longer having those fees is pretty awesome. 

I was looking at Personal Capital and it showed my day-to-day losses were less than the three benchmarks I compare against. 

I'm down to about 25 percent of the rollover cash still in the account. I'm thinking of no longer doing daily purchases and moving to weekly; 

1. purchasing every day is starting to lose its appeal,
2. over 80 percent of the cash is in the funds,
3. I'm still making my regular contributions,
4. the overall portfolio is almost back in balance (except for cash),
4. this money has about a 17 year incubation period, and
5. the market is still consistently going down from week-to-week.

I'm starting to reconsider what constitutes market timing for me; [more on that below](#timing-the-market).

### Day 12 results

Went with the 10, 20, 30, 40 again; I didn’t contribute to the total stock market or the S&P 500 funds since the orders executed last pat paycheck, which was unexpected.

The market closed up, so, this seems like a good time to try the other setup.

2 of the 8 orders executed; the ones at the current market price.

### Day 13 results

Went with the 15, 35, 50 this time since the market closed up during day 12.

Market closed down.

6 of the 6 orders executed; only the multi-factor and extended market funds.

### Day 14 results

Went with the 10, 20, 30, and 40 percent this time. Went toward all 4 funds this time because the values were almost at their targets.

At the fund-level, the S&P 500 fund is under its minimum; everything else is at least above the minimum. At the style- or factor-level, we’re above the minimums. And, of course, at the allocation for the data above we’re also within limits&hellip;except cash.

## Closing M1 Finance

Main M1 Finance Pie was down almost 40 percent, so, not contributing more there yet. Wish M1 Finance allowed for limit orders. Further, with their first round of buys could happen after the first 30 minutes of the market being open; without paying for it.

Basically more reasons for me to preference Vanguard or similar over M1 Finance.

## Update on the dip

On the first of October, 2022 I did a quick history check and discovered that the price for each fund (except the multi-factor fund) was at about what it was in 2020; cue [Cher](https://youtu.be/9n3A_-HRFfc). For the extended market fund, it was actually lower.

## Timing the market

When it comes to investing there seems to be a lot of fear-, skill-, and intelligence-based arguments against timing the market. 

> You have to be able to predict two times, once to withdraw at the top and again to reinvest at the bottom.

Or, another one that's been coming to mind as of late (and previously):

> If you have a bunch of cash sitting on the sidelines it can cause a cash-drag on the portfolio.

There are similar sentiments related to this idea. I started thinking about these sentiments recently as I've been doing the [401k rollover](#401k-rollover), because what I'm doing fits pretty closely to the [Investopedia article](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/markettiming.asp) description of market timing; however, I'm not sure if what I'm doing there actually is market timing, strictly speaking.

What’s the difference between market timing and taking advantage of an otherwise unfortunate circumstance; buying a dip?

The main assumption when it comes to the hot-takes regarding market timing is the idea that you are moving all the value from being in the market to being out of the market or selling a large chunk from one place to move it to another place. From the article:

> Market timing is the act of moving investment money in or out of a financial market—or switching funds between asset classes—based on predictive methods.

Also:

> Market timing is not impossible to do. Short-term trading strategies have been successful for professional day traders, portfolio managers, and full-time investors who use chart analysis, economic forecasts, and even gut feelings to decide the optimal times to buy and sell securities.

Another one I like is:

> The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.

Here's why I think what I'm doing is different:

1. I'm not using one or more predictive methods as the basis for my decisions.
2. I'm not planning on making this my main, or even regular strategy; still buy-and-hold and dollar cost averaging as usual.
3. I'm not selling anything with the purpose of moving it to somewhere else.

I don't think this is me trying to convince myself of anything; rather, it's me trying to learn and understand something.

I didn't sell the 401k at my former employer because I thought it would keep going down while something else would either not go down as much or would actually go up in the short-term. In part I did it to simplify things:

1. one less account to babysit,
2. reduce the places and types of funds used, and
3. reduce recurring administrative fees.

Instead of having a 401k at one place, another somewhere else, and a Traditional [.Individual Retirement Account](IRA) somewhere else, I only have the 401k and Traditional IRA. Instead of having a small-, mid-, and large-cap fund (a restriction set by my former employer in the account), I have the exact 4 funds I want at the moment and the ability to choose from many more. Instead of having the expense ratios for the funds in addition to administrative costs on the account, I only have the expense ratios of the funds.

I'm not waiting for the bottom of this dip, recession, or depression (whatever it decides it wants to be when it grows up) before starting my regular contributions again (I never stopped them in the first place). I'm not even waiting for the bottom to put the 401k rollover money back into the market.

The timing for me and investing has been fascinating.

I started contributing to the 401k at my former employer in 2019, just up to the employer match. I turned up the contributions in 2021 to hit the annual limit; the run-up to 2022. My contributions to that account ended in July, 2022. I sold everything in mid-September. This means most of the gains made in 2021 were lost. With that said, if I did the math right, looking at total cost versus total value at the time of sale, I lost anywhere from 50 to 75 percent of the value of my former employer's contributions. 

Let's say the total cost put in was 50,000 [.United States Dollars](USD). Further, let's say it was a 6 percent match, which would be 3,000 USD. I missed out on (or lost) up to 2,250 USD. With that said, for this hypothetical, I still walked away with 47,750 USD I didn't have before.

Beyond that, I've been contributing the annual limits to my Roth IRA and HSA along with putting money into my taxable brokerage account; without fail.

So, I've experienced an exuberant market and a bear market within 24 months of going at it with any type of fervor.

Anyway.

I don't know what the market will do. I'm not guessing at what it might do. When it will hit bottom. How long it will take to recover. I have no control there. However, I can see what the market is doing and has been doing in the past few days, weeks, and months; and it's still going down with blips here and there.   

I remember in 2021 when I was working out the misunderstanding with the [.Internal Revenue Service](IRS), I was so impatient and concerned over the "cash-drag" having all the cash to potentially pay taxes and fees. Eventually, I decided to go ahead and deploy that cash; or, at least a majority of it. Now, I still own those shares, and their value is less than the initial cost; to be clear, this is fine, the important thing is to learn to not chase returns, which is what it felt like in retrospect—serious case of [.Fear Of Missing Out](FOMO). And it cuts both ways as happened in the beginning of 2022 because I didn't want to miss out on the dip—only for it to continue throughout the year and up to this point; returning pretty much to where it was 12 months ago from a price per share perspective. Meanwhile, the value of my portfolio overall has continued to increase slowly or plateau, so, I'm finding that to be pretty fascinating and helpful in dealing with the psychology of things.

My thoughts right now are that it's more important to be consistent once you start. When I started investing it was because I felt I was in a position to commit to investing regularly.
