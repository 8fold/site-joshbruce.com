The regular dollar cost averaging purchases were made. I don’t have enough investable cash to do much in the taxable brokerage account.

I’ve actually felt pretty good the last few days from a [health and wellness](/experiences/health-and-wellness/) perspective. I’m hoping it maintains.

I’m considering switching out the small-cap fund to something that leans smaller and more toward value. I still don’t like that the expense ratio will be almost double the current fund. With that said, the price per share is less and the fund had a split this year.

Spent a fair amount of money on health and wellness, clothes, and some other quality of life things. I’m really focusing in the health and wellness area.
