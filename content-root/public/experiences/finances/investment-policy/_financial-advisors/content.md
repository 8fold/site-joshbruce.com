# Financial advisors

{!! dateblock!!}

I was offered a free consultation with the folks at [Personal Capital](https://www.personalcapital.com) and I took it. During the call they asked a question I hadn’t considered:

> What would it take for you to take on an advisor?

My immediate response was:

> They have to be willing to teach and counsel me to the point that they could become obsolete.

In other words, if part of the relationship depends on me being dependent on the other person without growing and learning, that’s not going to work for me. If life has taught me anything, it’s impermanence and if my advisor disappears without teaching me how to fish, well, that’s not okay.

There’s a fear there though. I recognize, acknowledge, and have lived through that fear; I put myself out of business (or a job) on a recurring basis. And I still believe part of my job is to help my clients outgrow me, so to speak; like a [roller derby whip or push](https://youtu.be/l-J4h1kb8Ho).

Questions I think I’ll ask the next time the subject comes up.

## Who is your ideal client?

This could be for the advisor or the firm as a whole.

If their ideal client is a mid-level executive with a salary over two-hundred thousand dollars per year and a net worth of a million [.United States Dollars](USD), well, that’s not me, yet.

They may not be able to meet me where I am to make choices that are right for me to grow into being their ideal client.

Remember the whip (or the push).

## Are you a fiduciary in all aspects of your business 

Fiduciary is a legal term in the United States. It means the advisor is legally obligated to make decisions based on the best interest of the client, even if that advice is not in the best interest of the advisor or the firm.

The “all aspects” component means they don’t wear multiple hats. In some cases an advisor may be fiduciary in the advice, but not when it comes to selling certain vehicles related to that advice:

> Buy an index fund (fiduciary hat). We offer this one (non-fiduciary hat).

## What are all the fees

Some financial planners are referred to as fee-only. Of course, “fee-only” is a pretty broad term. The various food delivery services that have popped up are also fee-only and after taxes and fees a 10 USD meal can quickly turn into 50 USD.

Specifically, the fees could include and may not be limited to:

- Expenses on index funds; paid to the fund manager.
- Assets under management fees; a percentage of your net worth managed by the individual or firm.
- Flat service fees; a specific amount for a given service or type of call (think hospital bill).
- Transaction fees; becoming less common, but it’s often a flat fee applied to perform certain services. (When I called Vanguard to convert my non-Vanguard fund in my Roth [.Individual Retirement Account](IRA) to a Vanguard fund, I was charged 25 USD because I did it over the phone instead of online; doing it myself online would have been free.)

In short, and hopefully it’s not too surprising, the more burden you take on, the lower the cost out of pocket. You’re paying the fees for the convenience and delegation of certain activities.

It’s worth noting that if you ask to see a few schedule and are met with a wall-o-text that rivals The Bible in length, or, you have to go searching for internally referenced documents, probably not worth pursuing. If it says somewhere that other fees may apply, decide for yourself whether it’s worth asking to see the other fees.

Instead it should be obvious:

1. What the fee is for.
2. How much the fee is (in USD or percent).
3. Why the fee exists, which may be different than the first.

For example, [Wave](https://www.waveapps.com) offers payment process services for credit cards:

1. It’s for processing credit card transactions.
2. The fee is listed on [their website](https://www.waveapps.com/payments/credit-cards) and is combination of a flat-fee plus a percentage of the transaction.
3. Wave is charged by the credit card issuers.

You’re trying to answer the related question: How do you make money?

Few people in the financial services industry have managed to do so well that they’ve decided to start throwing out personalized advice for free.

## What services are provided 

If you’re taking these in order and make it this far, you probably have a decent idea; that fee schedule probably has a lot of it.

Mainly we’re trying to figure out what services are part of what fees.

For example, let’s say I’m considering hiring an advisor; not a financial advisor, just an advisor. They charge a flat retainer fee of 50 USD per month. This includes family planning, realtor recommendations for home purchases, preparing for child education, and estate planning. I would only take advantage of one of those services, which raises the question of whether it would be worth 50 USD per month for me.

This also ties back to the question about the ideal client. Given this bundle of services, I’m  not their ideal client.

## What credentials do you have

There’s a credential for just about anything. With that said, some industries are, as of today, unregulated or have minimal regulation.

A board certified doctor is very different, legally, from Sam down the street who knows how to sew anything from cotton to human flesh. Same with a lawyer. Same with certified public accountants.

When it comes to coaching, consulting, software development, and financial planning and advising, not so much; however, credentials still exist. I have about nine for Agile software development, for example.

The two big credentials in the financial advising space are the [.Certified Financial Analyst](CFA) and the [.Certified Financial Planner](CFP).

Both require a certain amount of training and the completion of an exam; as with most credentials, check out the official websites for details: [CFA](https://www.cfainstitute.org/en/programs/cfa) and [CFP](https://www.cfp.net).

Coupled to this question might be related questions like:

- Why do you love what you do?
- How long have you wanted to do this?
- How long have you been doing this?

## What is your process

This could be rephrased to something like: 

> How will we work together?

One advisor I spoke with generated quarts reports and did annual phone calls, for example.




I have major baggage and biases when it comes to money and I think this question is helping me unpack that a bit, which is the point of the [finances](/experiences/finances/) area of this site.

My mother’s side of the family were pretty much all farmers; peanuts, cotton, corn, and so on. There’s a certain level of distrust for bankers and the Government there. One of my favorite quotes came from my uncle: No one’s gonna care about your money as much as you do.

My dad’s side of the family were much all military for at least minimal service. Again, a certain level of mistrust there.

Both sides are filled with fiercely independent folks; most of whom have run, started to run, or have had multiple side hustles. The do-it-yourself crowd.

Here’s the rub.

I’m trying to break that cycle with myself.
