# Personal budget

{!!dateblock!!}

This is the highlight reel; not limited to the positive things.

## Early thirties

Income: Less than 70,000 USD per year.

Savings rate: At least 10 percent of take home.

Savings vehicles: Regular savings and a Roth IRA.

Living in my car was amazing. I worked the census for most of 2010 and was able to start crawling out of debt. It wasn’t all sunshine and rainbows and there was a night in particular when the universe and I had a talk.

“You need to figure out what you’re doing with me because I’m tired of trying and failing. Either you start helping me or you let me go, because I’m tired of this shit. Either way I win because kid will start getting better or I’ll be dead. You pick. And pick soon. Because I’m gonna be sitting here all back of the bus waiting for you to decide. If you decide to help instead of letting me go, I promise I will do what I can to help others in the ways I can.”

The next day the Census folks called me to let me know training was going to start. I went in humble as fuck with the mindset of helping others.

I was promoted. Then I was promoted again.

I had a minor argument with my dad about not getting interviews; I was still applying to at least job per day. He managed to get me an interview with the company he worked for; I didn’t get that job.

Then I was asked to stay on for another operation with the Census, and another.

One day a recruiter called and asked if I wanted to work at WebMD for about 50,000 USD per year.

I said yes.

Got a studio apartment. Continued sleeping on the floor. Was feeling pretty good about life.

One day someone from my dad’s company called and asked if I wanted to move to the DC-Metro-Virginia area as a government contractor for 65,000 USD a year.

I said yes.

## Late twenties

Income: Less than 30,000 USD per year.

Savings rate: Nothing.

Savings vehicles: Regular savings and a Roth IRA.

In the early days of living in Atlanta I’d spend my weeks in Big Canoe helping my uncle doing general labor; construction. My weekends would be spent in Atlanta trying to figure out what I needed to do next to keep my student loans in deferment and become gainfully employed.

I was also trying reconcile and figure out my life and relationship to it.

Started freelancing full-time and was able to survive.

I still applied to regular employers, but never got an interview and stopped keeping the rejection letters.

Around 2009 I found myself unable to pay rent. A brief stint living with another friend and I decided to live in my car.

This time, everything I owned fit in the trunk of the same four door sedan.

## Mid-twenties

Income: Less than 30,000 USD per year.

Savings rate: Nothing.

Savings vehicles: Regular savings accounts.

I quit the credit union for a year to attend an out-of-state school. Had a nervous breakdown, quit that school, and went back to Ohio.

Got my credit union job back and started at a university there.

Still living with my dad and step-mom, I paid them a small rent and scraped by.

This was a pretty dark period in my life. I was going through the motions but I wasn’t actually living.

Life was happening to me without my participation.

After a relapsed breakdown, my parents moved me out of their house and into a studio apartment with a broken stove and one window completely obscured by a bush. My sense of self worth was diminishing quickly. 

A year before graduating university I rallied a bit and made a promise to myself that if I was working at the same company in the same capacity a year after graduating, I wouldn’t be working there anymore. I figured this would light a fire under my ass to “get out there” or be “more ambitious.”

I rallied a bit and moved into an apartment above a bookstore with a working stove and a lot of windows.

On the lighting a fire front, it worked. I sent my curriculum vitae to at one day per day. I applied to positions internal to the credit union. 

I received over 500 hundred rejection letters. This doesn’t include the folks who never responded at all. I kept them in a folder with a label reading something like: I’ll show you.

I probably went on seven interviews in that entire time; most of those internal to the credit union. I didn’t get any of this jobs.

I started sleeping through my alarm; I literally would not hear it. I would arrive late to work, sometimes by hours. When I would wake up I found myself upset that I was still alive and that I couldn’t stop my heart or my breathing through sheer force of will.

I rallied a bit again when I was invited to an Air Force function by a civilian member of the credit union who wanted to help me get enrolled in a program she was part of.

At the same time I applied for another internal position at the credit union. And suddenly arrive one or two minutes late wasn’t acceptable; despite having adding hours late without question just a month or so prior. One defining moment and conversation later and I turned in my two weeks notice.

I didn’t even consider my student loans and credit card debt. 

Long story short, I quit my job at the beginning of the [Great Recession](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession), moved to Atlanta, and vowed never live in Ohio again (for multiple reasons).

I reduced what I owned to what could fit in the trunk and backseat of my four door sedan.

## Early twenties 

Income: Less than 30,000 USD per year.

Savings rate: About 10 percent of take home.

Savings vehicles: Regular savings accounts.

Got my first job offer as a web designer. Quit my job at the office supply store to pursue it; would have made around 35,000 USD per year. Dot-com bubble burst and the job fell through before it even started.

I didn’t try to get my job back at the office supply store; a bit of ego held me back.

I tried freelancing for a while, still living with my dad. Tried lead-generated sales; I didn’t make the cold calls, but I went to people’s houses to talk to them about the system and service. I sold one in the couple of months I was there; the company shutdown shortly after I left.

Started working at a credit union and was the for quite some time and they paid for most of my first two years of college.

I was living like a king, in my mind, and life was progressing just fine.

## Before my twenties 

Income: Less than 30,000 USD per year.

Savings rate: Nothing.

Savings vehicles: Nothing.

Most of my money I would get from my dad. I didn’t have an allowance or anything. I’d just for twenty bucks here and there; never more than twenty bucks at a time. I’d rarely, if ever, ask for stuff.

During this time I took a lot of short-term “unskilled” employment:

1. fast food for a year,
2. as a temporary agent for a stock broker and oil company for a few months while visiting my mom,
3. at a plastic injection molding factory, and
4. an office supply store.
