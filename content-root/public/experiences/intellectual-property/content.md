# Intellectual property

{!! dateblock !!}

Disclaimer: We're about to talk about the possibility of getting sued, not me—you. I'm not an attorney. I don't play one on television, much less on the Internet. I'm a human on the Internet trying to articulate something to the best of my knowledge based on the research done and history. Before taking action on anything you've read here, please speak with your own advisors and attorneys. (This is pretty much the same disclaimer for the entire site that can be found in the [Terms of Service](https://joshbruce.com/legal/) as well.)

I get weird around "loose language." I'm also loose with my language sometimes, so, not claiming sainthood here. My weirdness usually shows up based on something my mother told me once.

We were talking on the phone when I was about 12 or 13 years old. I was throwing out curse word after curse word. My mom, being a battered woman's counselor for years, didn't really bat an eyelash. At one point, I went to take a breath, and she interjected, "Joshua?" I didn't read too much into her using my full name, she always called me that, so I didn't know if I was in trouble or not. 

"Yeah," I replied. I may not have known if I was in trouble, but I knew we were about to have a conversation. 

"We call those curse words for a reason."

"Okay?" I replied.

"The thing about curse words," she continued, "is that they only have power because they are rarely used. The more you use them, the less power they have."

That was it. I didn't curse much on the phone after that. 

But, *fuck*, my self-reflective punk-ass was floored, and I thought about it for the rest of the day.

I love my partner, Becca. I tell her all the time. You know what I don't say I love? Much else. Instead, I say, "I appreciate," or "I like," or similar. "Love" is a "power word" (according to my mother). To be fair, after almost a decade of saying "I love you" a half dozen times every day, we recently seem to have switched to saying "I *like* you..." in a specifically "us" kind of way. It seems to be a palette cleanser. 

"Hate" is also a power word.

Becca was taken aback when I told her, "I hate Ohio."

Let's try a different example I use a lot. If someone known for gangster rap says, "Fuck you!" chances are, it's not that big of a deal. Now imagine The Pope saying the same thing.

This brings us to the word "invent."

I've been seeing folks recently say, "I *invented*..."

Here's the thing: From a denotation perspective, not that big of a deal. According to the *Oxford English Dictionary*, our common use of the term means: create or design (something that has not existed before); be the originator of.

From a connotation and intellectual property perspective, though, kind of a big deal.

To "invent" implies "patent," and "patent" implies I have exclusive rights over the "invented" thing and can sue your ass.

Because I'm writing this post, I own the copyright (not a patent) because:

1. there's no contract with someone else to the contrary;
2. if I were a ghostwriter, the contract would typically stipulate that I don't own the copyright for the thing I wrote the majority of (think Generative AI in human form—also, recommend watching the movie [*Bicentennial Man*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicentennial_Man_(film))); and
3. to the best of my knowledge, this article is a unique expression of what we're going to talk about.

I didn't *invent* this article.

I interact with a fair number of folks in "creative industries," sometimes referred to as "knowledge work" or "the arts," and I'd like to take a moment to clear up a myth. I don't need to register this content with anyone to establish copyright (at least not in The [.US](United States)). It might help my case should I decide to try and sue someone if they take the content and present it as their own, but still, not required ([Copyright.gov website](https://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-general.html)).

There is no additional cost or time beyond the time it took to acquire the knowledge and write the thing. And, of course, survive long enough on this planet to do all the above.

Copyright has the longest lifespan of intellectual property in the US because it's tied to the lifespan of the legal entity owning the copyright. Winnie the Pooh without a shirt is in the public domain now; anyone can use the imagery and name without fear of getting sued. To be fair, anyone could have used it prior to that as long as they talked with and got permission from the owner beforehand. ("Hi, can I use your salt?")

Winnie the Pooh with a shirt? Copyrighted by Disney. Mickey Mouse from Steamboat Willy, public domain. Anything written by William Shakespeare—public domain.

Wanna make a YouTube channel reciting Shakespeare with a shirtless Winnie the Pooh and Steamboat Willy Mickey Mouse? No problem. The hard part is getting enough subscribers and listeners to qualify to receive ad revenue.

With that out of the way, let's talk about some other types of intellectual property protected by law.

Trade secrets: The [.KFC](Kentucky Fried Chicken) herbs and spices are a trade secret. Someone other than KFC may actually know the recipe. They may use it to fry their chicken. They may sell that chicken to other people. 

They may get taken to court or asked politely to stop doing that (often, the request is in a physical letter from an attorney and called "cease and desist"). Trade secrets are legally protected so long as the person with the "trade secret" has made a "reasonable attempt" [not to disclose said secret](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trade-secret.asp). KFC famously locks that shit in a volt. Franchise owners and employees of corporate locations don't mix it on-site. It comes in bags like a drug deal in *Dune*. If it gets transported, it's done in a metal suitcase handcuffed to someone's wrist, like in a spy movie from the ʼ80s. (Or so the stories go.)

Like copyright, you get trade secrets for no additional cost.

Next are trademarks (not to be confused with trade names). In case you aren't aware, [The Scrum Guide](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html) is technically The Scrum Guide™. The little "TM" is an expression of intent to register it eventually. As long as the words, phrases, and iconography become associated with one or more legal entities, they have more legal standing, but not as much as if they registered it.

Like trade secrets and copyrights, you get this for no additional cost. I *created* The Action Loop and could have [The Action Loop™](/essays-and-editorials/action-loop/), for example.

What's a registered trademark? I'm so glad you asked, mythical reader!

Two things make a registered trademark different than, well, just a trademark (naming things is hard). A registered trademark just means we registered it with a government body. Once we do that, we can turn the "TM" into the "R" with a circle around it (®). Again, this is an unobtrusive way to say, "Hey, this word, phrase, iconography, or combination, in reference to this thing, is exclusively ours; be very careful how you use it because I can probably sue your ass." The registered version also says that a third party tasked with such things (the government) has looked around the related industry and found no other registered (or unregistered) trademark that could be easily confused with this one.

Prior to 2008, if I knew the KFC recipe, I could not use the following phrase in my advertising: COLONEL SANDERS' RECIPE KENTUCKY FRIED CHICKEN (sorry for the caps, copy-paste). If the [reference document](https://trademarks.justia.com/722/65/colonel-sanders-recipe-kentucky-fried-chicken-72265370.html) is to be believed, the registration expired in 2008. Therefore, I could use it, but I'd probably get asked (nicely, in writing, by an attorney) to stop using it because it implies trade secret infringement. To be clear, it implies that I know the KFC recipe, which is protected as a trade secret. Also, KFC is pretty ubiquitous, and it could cause confusion if I advertise "Josh's Chicken, using Colonel Sanders' Recipe Kentucky Fried Chicken."

To make this feel less like you need to be a big-ass company to protect your shit, The Pomodoro Technique is technically The Pomodoro® Technique. If you use the process, reference that name, and want to be a nice person (while reducing the risk of a letter or lawsuit), you want to comply with the guidelines of the [trademark owner](https://www.pomodorotechnique.com/pomodoro-trademark-guidelines.php). Francesco Cirillo is a person, not a company. He is the owner. That said, he has transferred responsibility for protecting the trademark (suing your ass) to a company owned by him: Cirillo Consulting GmbH.

Typically we wait to register a trademark until the word, phrase, iconography, or combination has become associated with us and "our thing." Sometimes folks wait until people start using said word, phrase, iconography, or combination to a point where "it just makes sense" to register it. Or, we register it because other people try to register something similar. 

Apple has a [lengthy list of trademarks](https://www.apple.com/legal/intellectual-property/trademark/appletmlist.html). Chances are you've never heard of or said iBook™, which is related to a "computer." Instead, you've probably heard of or said iPad® + iBooks®. Notice which ones have the circled "R."

A patent is, for lack of a better way of saying it, the height of intellectual property accomplishment.

1. You have exclusive rights to pursue the value of what the patent describes, just like the exclusive nature of copyright and registered trademarks.
2. It only lasts for 20 years, regardless of the name or names on it.
3. Your thing is compared against other things in similar fields of study to determine its uniqueness as being beyond the "state of the art" at the time. This is important; if a person reasonably familiar with that field of study could have come up with whatever you're trying to patent, you most likely won't receive a patent. If someone else has already patented something similar, you most likely won't receive a patent. If someone else has publicly prototyped, produced, or talked at length about whatever you're trying to patent, you most likely won't receive a patent.

This is where I get weird about people saying they "invented" something. If I tell you I invented something, that means I own a patent. Otherwise, I "created" something. Or, I "put something together." Or "made a thing." Or I "named a thing." Or I "trademarked" something. Or I even "own the copyright" on something. 

Whatever.

Lots of alternatives I could use. Like a lot, a lot. But they don't sound as important as "I invented..."

Now, I want to kind of address or at least acknowledge that not everyone appreciates intellectual property rights (in some cases, they may not even like property rights, period). That's cool. No judgment. Also, not where we're at right now as a species. That said, I want to introduce the elephant in the room when it comes to patents and why I'm pretty okay with them.

A patent is only good for 20 years and can't be re-registered. So, you have an awesome (unique and state-of-the-art) idea that will change the world (or at least your field of study). Great! 

For 20 years, you can pursue whatever value *you* want for it. 

Also, there are maintenance fees. If the maintenance fees aren't paid, then your patent may "end early," for lack of a better term, but whatever it is, is still now in the public domain. (Some universities create a lot of patents as part of their nonprofit mission, but you can bet your ass they get paid when people use them before they expire. Same thing with NASA.)

The "whatever value" part is important. It could be money received from producing the product and service yourself and selling it. It could be licensing it to other people who pay you for the privilege of using it. 

If you do accept money from those people, it may be a penny per unit sold. Dude, it may be percent ownership in the company. It could also be a basket of cookies (which is just above doing it for "the exposure"). 

The "value" can be whatever you, the patent holder, are willing to accept and whatever the consumer is willing to pay. Welcome to the "free (read voluntary) market." If you charge too much, are an asshole, or both, no worries. Humans have survived this long without your idea. We can wait another 20 years. (There are some sketchy and shady as fuck edge cases, but they aren't the norm.)

Anyway, it all depends on the contract that's negotiated (we'll circle back to that). 

For you, having a patent could be a way to convince someone to hire you at a company; the two folks who later created Google tried to get Yahoo! to pay them to use their original search engine algorithm patent—Yahoo! said, "There's no money in search engines." Inventing something (sorry, I mean holding a patent) looks good on a résumé. You may even decline to accept money for a lot of stuff; see Nikola Tesla.

Once it's in the public domain (and no longer protected), anyone can use it for whatever reasons they want; they don't even need to give you credit (now I have [*Say My Name*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQgd6MccwZc) stuck in my head). To be clear, another person can literally say (or imply), "I *invented* this thing..." 

Back to KFC (I wonder why I'm getting hungry).

KFC had a patent on [frying chicken under pressure]((https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/fe/68/60/0ecfba473c23dc/US3245800.pdf). I say "had" because the patent is over 20 years old, and the method is in the public domain. But no one says, "We fry our chicken under pressure, just like KFC." (Say my name, say my name...)

Google had a patent on its search engine algorithm. I say "had" because the patent is over 20 years old. It's funny how a bunch of competing search engines suddenly appeared when that happened. However, I haven't seen a search engine yet say, "We're basically just like original-Google when it comes to results." That said, I have seen most of them say, "We're not like Google because of XYZ reasons." (Say my name, say my name...)

Do you remember those fidget spinner things that were all the rage for like 3 years around 2017? Yep. 

There was a patent for that, and it expired. The *inventor* (to the best of my understanding) didn't get a dime (see this [Dahl Law Group article](https://tqdlaw.com/intellectual-property-insights-the-fidget-spinners-untold-story/)). So, just because you get a patent doesn't mean you'll become rich within those 20 years. Further, it doesn't even mean it will be available in the marketplace within those 20 years. Finally, just because you didn't get rich off of your *invention* doesn't mean a whole bunch of other people won't get rich off of it 20 years or so later.

[When the iPhone® was released](https://youtu.be/LOb3FJhDbYs), Steve Jobs was on stage and said:

> We're introducing a technology called Multi-Touch™. [...] And, boy, have we patented it.

My understanding is that the particular patent was about software, not hardware. Software is a difficult thing to patent. I also understand that the Apple patent related to multi-touch was revoked. Someone said, "I did that a year or two before Apple, sorry." Notice "Multi-Touch" doesn't have an "R" with a circle around it?

What did get patented and stuck is the design of the [slide to unlock](https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/6/16614038/apple-samsung-slide-to-unlock-supreme-court-120-million) functionality of the iPhone (almost 20 years old at this point). When Samsung did something similar, Apple sued Samsung because Apple *invented* that user experience design.

Two more.

Gilette patented a method for producing a [multi-blade razor](https://patents.google.com/patent/US775134A/en). While that patent was active, you might get sued if you did something similar unless you could prove beyond a reasonable doubt that your approach was different than the one patented. Becca now owns a non-Gilette multi-blade safety razor. The company making them doesn't have to pay anything to or acknowledge the existence of Gilette. (Say my name, say my name...)

Drilling into "beyond a reasonable doubt" and back to copyright.  [Vanilla Ice was sued](https://www.msn.com/en-us/music/news/what-queens-brian-may-thought-of-vanilla-ice-sampling-controversy/ar-AA1l9s4R) for using (sampling?) a famous bassline without permission of the copyright holder.

I could go on. But I won't.

Shifting gears, there are certain things you can't patent. 

The mechanics used in a game—nope. 

You can copyright the presentation of the mechanics (see [4th Earth: RAW](https://raw.4th.earth)). You can trademark a label for those mechanics and register that trademark. What you can't do ([Wizard's of the Coast](https://www.npr.org/2023/01/25/1151474346/proposed-copyright-changes-have-dungeons-and-dragons-fans-up-in-arms)), is sue someone for rolling some dice and applying the same rules written in a unique way by someone else. Some things [can't be patented](https://www.uspto.gov/patents/basics/essentials) and are barely protectable under intellectual property law—believe it or not.

(Quick jab, with nothing but love and respect: no one *invented* any Agile Framework or specific way of working—those are game mechanics.)

So, for my friends in creative fields, the following is to you specifically.

If you want to say you invented something, cool, you do you. Just realize, for whatever it's worth, I've probably lost a bit of respect for you (and the thing) if you don't have a patent or if it's not something that can be patented in the first place; pick a different word, please. It lands as a disingenuous presentation of the facts, otherwise known as self-important marketing hype. That's not to say it's impossible to create something unique; it's just *damn* hard. There are 8 billion people on the planet as of this writing, and many humans have been born and passed away while putting their ideas out there.

If you have a specific way of working that makes whatever it is you do unique, keep it secret and keep it safe. Call it a trade secret, which is free to you. If someone wants to know what it is, consider charging them for it. I'm not saying it needs to be 50 million dollars or all at once. 

Or, if you want to fight the "patent prison," describe it in enough detail that others can replicate it and make it public. You won't have the exclusive right to seek the value, but much like comments on blog posts from 20+ years ago, you can shout, "First!" (Sir Isaac Newton apparently used to do this all the time. Someone goes to publish a paper on the equation for gravity, and Newton's like, "Already did that, years ago, here it is.")

All that said, chances are, you aren't actually first. You might just become the most known—like Newton, Musk, Bell, and Ford.

I have mad empathy for creatives mainly because I am one. I create shit. It's what I do. Some of it, arguably, is good shit.

Many creatives have it drilled into us that "you can't make money at it" and that "you should do it for the love (or exposure), not the money." That said, we should take ownership of our part in the proliferation of the "starving artist" concept and not just be bitter and pissed off at other people "exploiting" us. 

Many people aren't willing or able to say, "[Fuck you. Pay me!](https://youtu.be/jVkLVRt6c1U)"

I propose that one of the reasons "knowledge workers" get paid so much is because of the contracts we sign; everything we create in the name of the employer isn't ours to pursue the value of. Apple famously paid a lot of engineers in company stock, or at least gave them the option. Steve Wozniak famously gave a lot of his stock to engineers working at Apple. The things "knowledge workers" create may be used by employers in perpetuity, making money from what was created long after they lay us off.

One reason "unskilled labor" is even a term (I don't like it, but still) is because the belief is that people working those jobs don't actually *invent* things or "innovate" in their fields; they don't create intellectual property.

ps. Let me put it into perspective. Warning, a lot of "ifs" in here:

1. If you're able to create a logo for a company, and
2. if that logo sticks for a while (as they often do), and
3. if that company makes billions of dollars at present or eventually (most don't)

that logo will have helped in making that happen.

The Nike logo, used since 1971, cost Nike 35 [.USD](United States Dollars), Nike later gave her, the designer, 500 shares of stock. The 2008 redesign of the Pepsi logo? 1 million USD. The BBC logo? 1.8 million USD. Accenture paid 100 million USD for theirs. ([Source](https://www.brandcrowd.com/blog/famous-logos-and-how-much-they-cost/))

It's not about what's created. The size, medium, or how many hours it took. It's about the impact and how long it sticks around. That's what your clients are paying for. 

When I freelanced full-time as a web developer, I made software that was pretty "bulletproof." Some of those clients used the same software for over a decade. One of them still hasn't changed the original code I wrote almost 13 years later. I made about 2,000 USD for my time on that one.

That's on me, not them.

To be fair, I didn't need to find the client, market the services to get the client, and so on.
