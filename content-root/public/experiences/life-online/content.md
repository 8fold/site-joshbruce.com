## Facebook fade away

To get to all of the following, click on your profile picture, and click on "Settings and Privacy."

- Settings: 
	- Transfer (or download) a copy of your information - photos and videos.
		- [Download a copy of your content](https://www.facebook.com/help/212802592074644); you only have 4 days from when the file is ready to when it needs to be downloaded.
	- [Remove imported contacts](https://www.facebook.com/mobile/messenger/contacts/).
- Privacy checkup (who can see what you share):
	- Email: Set to "Only me".
	- Birthday: Set both values to "Only me".
	- Friends and following: Set to "Only me"; recommend doing this regardless of whether you plan to fade away from Facebook.
	- Default audience: Set to "Only Me".
	- Stories: Set to "Custom" and choose 1 person.
	- Limit past posts.
- Privacy checkup (how people can find you):
	- Who can send friend requests: Set to "Friends of friends"; "no one" is not an option, so this is the closest we can get. We're working off the presumption that most people won't sift through someone's friend list, find you specifically, and send you a friend request.
	- Phone number and email: Set both to "Only me"; people can't look you up by your phone number or email address.
	- Search engines: Disable search engines outside Facebook from finding your posts and profile.
- Privacy checkup (how to keep your account secure):
	- Password: Change your password if you would like.
	- Enable two-factor authentication. This way, when you sign out, it will be harder to sign in.
	- Turn on alerts: Have Facebook email you if someone signs into your account from an unrecognized location. (We'll remove all previous sign-ins before signing out, so you'll always receive an email to ensure someone hasn't hijacked your account.)
- Privacy checkup (your data settings on Facebook: Remove all apps and websites).
- Privacy checkup (your ad preferences on Facebook):
	- Profile information: Disable all.
	- Who can see your social interactions alongside ads: Set to "Only me"; recommend doing this regardless.
- Privacy centerâ€”more robust than the Privacy checkup, we won't overlap those things that can be done using the Privacy checkup:
	- Protecting yourself and your information:
		- Limit who can see what you share: 
			- Remove tags from public posts. This should remove the link to your profile but maintain the name reference. Note: Comments are separate tags from posts, so you may have multiple to remove. Further, it only applies to public posts and should retain all friends-only or similar.
	- Keeping your information secure protects your privacy:
		- Review your security settings:
			- Where you're logged in: Log out of all the other devices. When we finish everything, we will use this to sign out of the account.
		- Authorized logins: Remove all other devices beyond the one you signed into.
		- Connected apps and logins: Remove all of them, and turn off the ability to sign into other websites using Facebook.
	- Control who can see what you share on Meta:
		- Review your sharing settings, select Messenger, and scroll to "How you get message requests": Set all to "Don't receive requests".
		- How to clean up your profile (View as): Check your profile as if you were someone else stumbling upon it. Then update as you see fit.
		- How to clean up your profile (Review past activity): 
			- Clear search history.
			- Clear videos you've watched.

That's pretty much it.
