# My books

I tend to favor publishing ebooks, which may be updated on occasion; buy once, keep forever. Once a print version is made available, however, the book will be considered a first edition and no content changes will be made, unless a new edition is published. I'm still working through how this works for audiobook versions; how much like an ebook are they?

### Triumph over Time

Stephen Covey described four generations of time (and possibly life) management. I see a fifth enveloping the first four; in the same way successive generations enveloped the ones before. The fifth generation solidifies and firmly plants the concepts of flow, agility, purpose, and by extension, mindfulness into self-management.

*Triumph over Time* helps usher in the fifth generation without emphasizing a specific approach or vantage, which is in keeping with the fifth generation itself.

*Triumph over Time* was all about theories and options. *Time: Mastering the Mundane* is about specifics steps in creating a productivity system that applies the values, principles, practices, and tools alluded to in *Triumph over Time*.

## Homeless not Hopeless (unpublished)

I spent most of 2010 living in my car.

It was not by choice.

It was one of the greatest experiences of my life.
