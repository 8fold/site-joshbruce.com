> I'm working on updating the structure and format of the site. Part of this change is separating the experiences and experiments (how I'm doing things) from the more informational aspects as well as consolidating information; the principles content has been moved to the [finances main page](/essays-and-editorials/finances/#the-three-principles-of-investing) and the 10 questions content has also moved to the [finances main page](/essays-and-editorials/finances/#the-10-questions).
>
> Further, information regarding the fund breakdown of my portfolio can be found in my [personal investment policy](/finances/investment-policy/#personal-portfolio).
