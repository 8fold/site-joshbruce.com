I responded:</p><blockquote><p>Process won’t save you.</p></blockquote><p>Humans aren’t machines executing code in a stepwise fashion. The hardware and software, if you will, that allows me to function in the world is different than the hardware and software that allows you to function in the world.</p><p>In short, humans are a hot mess.</p><p>Yet, many of us love the idea of universally applicable and repeatable practices, habits, processes, whatever. However, we also tend to explain all the reasons some arguably universal thing isn’t worth trying because we are unique in some way and “it won’t work here.”</p><p>In short, humans are a hot mess.</p><p>The African proverb comes to mind:</p><blockquote><p>If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.</p></blockquote><p>All of this is why I no longer believe in the existence of an uncuttable approach to existing as a human or “being productive.” At least not in formulaic detail.</p><p>And that’s a fucking struggle.</p><p>It’s easy to say, “If <em>those</em> people would just do X, then life would be better for everyone.” It’s difficult to say to yourself, “I’m shaming, blaming, and possibly being elitist as fuck right now.”</p><p>Which brings us to guidelines and guardrails.</p><p>Imagine you’re standing in the middle of a road. Down the center is a line. To your left and right, there are short barriers. Beyond the barriers is some gravel and glass. Beyond the gravel and glass are cliff edges. At the bottom of the cliff are jagged rocks and boulders and the height is pretty extensive.</p><p>That line down the center of the road is a guideline. The more I stick to it, the safer I am. Of course, sticking so closely to the guideline means I might miss seeing and experiencing the “outside world” (<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautama_Buddha">Buddha as protected prince</a> or <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0089886/">all science no philosophy</a>). But, that’s my choice to make. My line to draw. My line to toe.</p><p>Where things get dicey is when someone else tells us what lines to toe.</p><p>When I’m brought in as a coach it’s often to help with adoption and transformation. When I ask who chose the tool for tracking work, it’s rarely the people doing the work. When I ask if managers and “leadership” are tracking their work in the same tool, the answer is often no. When I ask who chose the process the team is supposed to use, it’s rarely the people doing the work; and, again, rarely is management and leadership trying to use a similar process.</p><p>“That’s for <em>those</em> people and would never work for us. But we know best what will work for <em>them</em>.” (“<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Farm">All animals are equal</a>, but some are more equal than others.“)</p><p>Then these same folks get frustrated because the people they manage (or lead) don’t feel empowered to make decisions and keep asking management for direction and what they should do next. (So much self-inflicted baggage.)</p><p>Guardrails are more hardcore than guidelines.</p><p>A habit I’ve gotten into, which some may find strange, is walking down the hallway to my apartment door with my eyes closed. I’ve never run into the walls. Granted, I’ve never gone the whole length without opening my eyes, re-centering, and realigning myself. The center is the guideline, the walls of the hallway are the guardrails. I walk slowly. The faster I go, the more often I open my eyes and readjust.</p><p>At no point am I in danger of serious injury. With that said, I will receive feedback that I’m off from my goal if I deviate too far for too long. It’s up to me to determine how to respond to that feedback; up to and including seeking advice and coaching beyond myself.</p><p>Unfortunately or fortunately, depending on your stance, teams in organizations don’t often choose the coach they get. Hell, they don’t get to choose their teammates or what they’re working on either, but anyway. And sometimes the rationale for why that’s the case is because the people doing the work don’t know what they need; or, the fear is the team will choose someone who will “let them get away with anything” thereby hurting the organization. (So much self-inflicted baggage.)</p><p>It can be patronizing, condescending, and self-deprecating.</p><p>When I’m brought into a team there are two things that often happen:</p><ol><li>I ask if the team wants more of a laid back professor or a war-torn drill instructor.</li><li>I figure out one change to make that I think is tiny.</li></ol><p>So far no one has chosen the laid back professor. Which indicates to me that most folks don’t want someone who will “let them get away with anything.” Asking those in my charge on how they want me to act. If they choose a way that I’m not willing to do given our context, we talk about it. It establishes a guideline.</p><p>The change I usually try to introduce revolves around “The Daily” and is based on what I’ve observed and discussed with the team for about a week. I want to know the individuals on the team and the interactions they want to have. From there we can start figuring out processes and tools to help us get there. I try to make the change small enough that I think the team can absorb it almost instantly.</p><p>In one case this change was for me, as the coach, to stop being the one calling on people to speak and asking for status. For this team, that was too much change to absorb and they told me they wanted to keep doing it the other way; me calling on people. This helped me gauge where they were.</p><p>Later we talked about it.</p><p>Why did they want me calling on them? What is the purpose of The Daily? Who’s the audience? Was I trying to shove what they viewed as my responsibilities onto them? And similar.</p><p>It’s easy to try and apply the same practices and tools in the same timescale to different groups of people and systems and expect similar results. It’s also easy to forget how long it took to go from a troubling place to a happy place and that the people here now aren’t the people that were there then.</p><p>For one client it took us three years and two leadership changes to decide using a design system would be beneficial. For another client they had a design system in place when I got there. For both it made sense to have one—for me and this site, a fully baked design system doesn’t make sense.</p><p>My place and context is different, therefore, I had to change my approach.</p><p>It’s easy to fall in the trap that others need to change. And, if we all share the view that others need to change, then nothing can change. For me, it’s an exercise in empathy and self-reflection. It’s about putting myself in their shoes by learning their history and why certain things trigger certain responses. It’s about reflecting on my own history and learning and acknowledging how little I know to be certain.</p><blockquote><p>What gets us into trouble is not what we don’t know. It’s what we know for sure that just ain’t so. (Mark Twain)</p></blockquote><p>The more detailed I am in how a team or organization <em>should</em> be, the more pain and suffering I typically cause and suffer myself. The more focused I am on those few uncuttable things, the more joy usually results. In other words, there is no “my way” there is only a way that’s working for the parties involved.</p><p>Everyone has a todo list. Not everyone writes it down or has the same amount of stuff.</p><p>Everyone has a way of prioritizing things on that list. Not everyone uses the same method(s) to do so.</p><p>Make things you want to do easy. Make things you don’t want to do difficult.</p><p>(There are others but going into them would start moving from abstract to concrete in a way that would be counterproductive to this article.)</p><p>By “working” I mean folks are maximizing the results they’ve identified as desirable while minimizing the results they’ve identified as undesirable.</p><p>I’m not sure how to meander gently to this last bit right now, so, let’s make a leap:</p><blockquote><p>Don’t try and bend the spoon, that’s impossible. Instead try and realize the truth [there is no spoon]. Then you’ll see it’s not the spoon that bends, it’s only yourself. (<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/uAXtO5dMqEI">The Matrix</a>)</p></blockquote><p>I don’t change people or organizations; I can’t control them. I can only control myself.</p><p>Therefore, I bend myself in the areas I’m willing and able to meet them where they are. Then we both figure out where we want to go together and possibly for how long. I think I’ve grown a lot over the years due in no small part to the clients I’ve served. I hope they feel the same about me.</p><p>Will we estimate work? Will it be in story points? Will we use micro-services? A todo list? Scrum, kanban, something else?</p><p>Who knows and who cares.</p><p>Will we try and make life better for those we serve? Without a doubt.</p></article><a id="go-to-top" href="#content-top">top</a><nav id="main-nav"><ul><li><a href="http://com.joshbruce-local:8889/">Josh bruce</a></li><li><a href="http://com.joshbruce-local:8889/design-your-life">Design your life</a><ul><li><a href="http://com.joshbruce-local:8889/design-your-life/motivators">Motivators</a></li><li><a href="http://com.joshbruce-local:8889/design-your-life/guidelines-and-guardrails">Guidelines and guardrails</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="http://com.joshbruce-local:8889/software-development">Software development</a><ul><li><a href="http://com.joshbruce-local:8889/software-development/why-dont-you-use">Why don’t you use</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="http://com.joshbruce-local:8889/web-development">Web development</a><ul><li><a href="http://com.joshbruce-local:8889/web-development/on-constraints">On constraints</a></li><li><a href="http://com.joshbruce-local:8889/web-development/modern-web-development">Modern web development</a></li><li><a href="http://com.joshbruce-local:8889/web-development/static-dynamic-and-interactive">Static, dynamic, and interactive</a></li><li><a href="http://com.joshbruce-local:8889/web-development/refactoring-re-engineering-and-rebuilding">Refactoring, re-engineering, and rebuilding</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="http://com.joshbruce-local:8889/finances">Finances</a><ul><li><a href="http://com.joshbruce-local:8889/finances/investment-policy">Investment policy</a></li><li><a href="http://com.joshbruce-local:8889/finances/building-wealth-paycheck-to-paycheck">Paycheck to paycheck</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="http://com.joshbruce-local:8889/full-navigation">Full list</a></li></ul></nav><footer><p>Copyright © 2004–2021 Joshua C.
