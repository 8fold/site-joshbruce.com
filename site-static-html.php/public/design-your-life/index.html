We even called days where we got together “gatherings” and we pretty much got together every day. A lot of times we just wanted a place where we felt safe to be ourselves.</p><p>Most of the time we played games and shot the shit.</p><p>It was hard to convince some of the parents of my friends that there wasn’t anything more interesting happening. They couldn’t believe that their kids would want to come to my house all the time unless there was sex, drugs, and rock-and-roll—along with speed, weed, and birth-control—going on. Funny part was I had three rules in my house:</p><ol><li>You can’t drink alcohol.</li><li>You can’t do drugs.</li><li>You can’t have sex.</li></ol><p>Those were my rules, not my dad’s. Basically, the only thing they were allowed to do at my house that they couldn’t do at home was curse and smoke cigarettes, which many of them didn’t even smoke.</p><p>On the days when we weren’t playing games and just chatting we would discuss existential issues. I know, 15, right? How deep could they gave been really?</p><p>To which I would like to turn to <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/davidbowie/changes.html">David Bowie</a>:</p><blockquote><p>And these children that you spit on</p><p>As they try to change their worlds</p><p>Are immune to your consultations</p><p>They’re quite aware of what they’re going through</p></blockquote><p>And, if you’re not into that one, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie_Scholl">Sophie Scholl</a> of the White Rose was 21 when she was executed for high treason against the Nazi Party; her brother was only 25.</p><p>In fact, ageism was often a topic of discussion at these gatherings.</p><p>Anyhoo.</p><p>One of the things I started telling my friends was that I just wanted to help them become the highest version of themselves possible and hoping they would help me become a better version of myself as well. It would be a long time later before realizing it wasn’t a Josh Bruce original. It would be even longer before I found I was able to essentially make a living at it.</p><p>While I focus on helping people make peace with time and space it’s really about helping you design your life.
