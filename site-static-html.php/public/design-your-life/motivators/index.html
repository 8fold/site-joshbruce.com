When I first read <em>Getting Things Done</em> by David Allen I seem to recall feeling there was an idea that identifying values and principles was not seen as helpful while you’re being overwhelmed; vacuuming while the house is on fire.</p><p>There’s definitely something to that.</p><p>Having said that, knowing where north is and having it written down beats all hell out of trying to find it in the dark. In early 2021 I decided to leave a project I was on despite not having another place to go and the client wanting me to stick around. This was something of an existential crisis for me.</p><p>The conversation in my head boiled down to two things:</p><ol><li>You’ve never given up before.</li><li>Why this time?</li></ol><p>So, I went to the documents that describe who I am in terms of values, principles, practices, and tools. And, in a few minutes, I knew exactly why I was determined to leave that gig.</p><p>If I didn’t have those things captured outside myself, it might have taken longer. (In fact, to be honest and transparent, it took me a day or two to go look at those documents—just not something I do regularly in crisis.)</p><p>The Motivators exercise can help you uncover and articulate your own character sheet. The exercise was inspired by Dan Pink’s work in the book <em>Drive</em>, Gary Chapman with the <em>The 5 Love Languages</em>, and some generation-based research.</p><p>The exercise comes in a short version and an extended version. Let’s start with the short.</p><p>You take a list of motivators and sort them in priority order for yourself from most motivating to least motivating. Here are the motivators:</p><dl><dt>Mastery:</dt><dd>Having a master-level understanding of the endeavors you pursue.</dd><dt>Autonomy:</dt><dd>The freedom to choose your own adventure; what you do, when you do, how you do, and so on.</dd><dt>Purpose:</dt><dd>The reason or “why” behind things.</dd><dt>Connection:</dt><dd>Relationships with others (<em>The 5 Love Languages</em>).</dd><dt>Process:</dt><dd>The order and formal nature of things.</dd><dt>Sticks:</dt><dd>Negative consequences for your actions.</dd><dt>Numbers:</dt><dd>The facts and figures of things (includes money).</dd><dt>Prestige:</dt><dd>The appreciation and recognition of others or a label that implies more responsibility or respect (office manager not secretary, custodial engineer not janitor, and so on).</dd></dl><p>Now, just put them in order. Here’s mine as of this writing (I review it about once a year):</p><ol><li>purpose,</li><li>autonomy,</li><li>mastery,</li><li>connection,</li><li>numbers,</li><li>process,</li><li>prestige, and</li><li>sticks.</li></ol><p>Here’s the thing, the order just ensures one thing is greater than the other. If you want, you can lay them out linearly on a scale to show the distance between them.</p><p>For example, my top four are pretty close to each other. “Sticks” though has a lot of distance between it and prestige; almost to the point of being able to say I’m anti-stick. You wanna threaten to hit me with a stick? I’ll probably let you hit me just out of spite; check out the movie Good Will Hunting when they’re talking about abusive parents.</p><p>Anyway. Let’s see what the expanded version looks like. Basically we’re going to replace “connection” with each of the five love languages. My extended version looks like this:</p><ol><li>purpose,</li><li>autonomy,</li><li><strong>physical touch (I’m big on hugs and high-fives)</strong>,</li><li><strong>words of affirmation</strong>,</li><li><strong>quality time</strong>,</li><li>mastery,</li><li>numbers,</li><li><strong>acts of service</strong>,</li><li><strong>receiving gifts</strong>,</li><li>process,</li><li>prestige, and</li><li>sticks.</li></ol><p>From this exercise I can start to get a sense of some basic values: purpose and autonomy, for example. This self-knowledge can help me reflect on practices and tools I use; are they in keeping with these values?</p><p>And this is how I find identifying your values, principles, practices (or habits), and tools goes. It’s nonlinear. You don’t need to figure out your life’s purpose <em>before</em> determining your values <em>before</em> stating your principles and so on. Instead, you can start by cataloging your practices and asking yourself why that’s a practice. Or start listing tools you use and ask why you use that tool.</p><p>Feel like another example is in order. I use pen-and-paper (tools) for capturing todo items (practice) because I don’t want to forget and I don’t want my mind cluttered. The last bit is in keeping with the principle: Your mind is for having ideas, not storing them. Further, the last bit is in keeping with my value of integrity (keeping my word to self and others).</p><p>There’s more but I want to keep it simple; another value I have. Hopefully it demonstrates the non-linear nature and how the simplest starting point can roll you into other things.</p><p>The Motivators exercise is a way to get away from the writer’s block often comes from being asked to figure out what you want to be if you grow up.</p></article><a id="go-to-top" href="#content-top">top</a><nav id="main-nav"><ul><li><a href="http://com.joshbruce-local:8889/">Josh bruce</a></li><li><a href="http://com.joshbruce-local:8889/design-your-life">Design your life</a><ul><li><a href="http://com.joshbruce-local:8889/design-your-life/motivators">Motivators</a></li><li><a href="http://com.joshbruce-local:8889/design-your-life/guidelines-and-guardrails">Guidelines and guardrails</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="http://com.joshbruce-local:8889/software-development">Software development</a><ul><li><a href="http://com.joshbruce-local:8889/software-development/why-dont-you-use">Why don’t you use</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="http://com.joshbruce-local:8889/web-development">Web development</a><ul><li><a href="http://com.joshbruce-local:8889/web-development/on-constraints">On constraints</a></li><li><a href="http://com.joshbruce-local:8889/web-development/modern-web-development">Modern web development</a></li><li><a href="http://com.joshbruce-local:8889/web-development/static-dynamic-and-interactive">Static, dynamic, and interactive</a></li><li><a href="http://com.joshbruce-local:8889/web-development/refactoring-re-engineering-and-rebuilding">Refactoring, re-engineering, and rebuilding</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="http://com.joshbruce-local:8889/finances">Finances</a><ul><li><a href="http://com.joshbruce-local:8889/finances/investment-policy">Investment policy</a></li><li><a href="http://com.joshbruce-local:8889/finances/building-wealth-paycheck-to-paycheck">Paycheck to paycheck</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="http://com.joshbruce-local:8889/full-navigation">Full list</a></li></ul></nav><footer><p>Copyright © 2004–2021 Joshua C.
