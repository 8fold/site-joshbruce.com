Testing will be done manualy for now as what I plan to write will require a running server environment.

There are three response codes I want to be able to support:

- 200 OK
- 404 Not found and
- 500 Internal server error

These will need to be checked in reverse.

1. 500: Conntent root directory not found. Or DotEnv required parameters not set.
2. 404: File for request URI could not be found within the content root directory.
3. 200: File found inside content root directory.

I'm not going to use the same template for the 404 and I did the 500. A server error should have fewer options than a 404. The user typically can't recover from the 500 by themselves; however, they can recover from a 404 relatively easily.

## Hard reset

total time: 0

If you look at the commit history you'll find the file history. I've decided to do a hard reset and move through this in a more systematic way.

I've removed all files except those in the `public` directory. I've removed all non-dev dependencies except `.env` to maintain the "secret" location of the content directory.
